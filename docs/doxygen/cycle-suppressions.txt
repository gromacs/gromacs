# Order (or more generally, edge selection) is significant (see gmxtree.md);
# "moduleA -> moduleB" means that moduleA should not depend on moduleB, and is
# a problem to be addressed at some point.

# Compat wants assertions and string code from utility, and other string code
# in utility wants to use string_view from compat. If we fix this, it might be
# best to implement the compat namespace within the utility module.
