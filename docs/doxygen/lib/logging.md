Logging {#page_logging}
=======

Currently, mdrun is using a combination of direct C-style I/O into `fplog` and
`stderr`, and the facilities described here.  However, more and more should get
moved to this interface in the future.

The parts that make up the logging system are shown below.

        builder [label="LoggerBuilder", URL="\ref gmx::LoggerBuilder"]
        owner [label="LoggerOwner", URL="\ref gmx::LoggerOwner"]
        logger [label="MDLogger", URL="\ref gmx::MDLogger"]
        target [label="ILogTarget", URL="\ref gmx::ILogTarget"]
        user [label="using code"]

        builder -> owner [label="builds"]
        owner -> logger
        owner -> target [label="owns"]
        logger -> target [label="references"]
        user -> builder [label="set logging targets"]
        user -> logger [label="write with\nGMX_LOG()"]
    }

To initialize the logging system, the using code creates an instance of
gmx::LoggerBuilder, and sets the desired logging targets with provided methods.
Once all targets have been initialized, the code calls
gmx::LoggerBuilder::build() and gets a gmx::LoggerOwner, which is responsible
of managing the memory allocated for the logger.

To log information, the using code uses an gmx::MDLogger returned by
gmx::LoggerOwner::logger() with the ::GMX_LOG macro.  Code that writes to the
log only needs to know of this class (and helper classes used to implement the
macro), which is a relatively simple container for references to the logging
targets.  If there is no log target that would consume the information written
with ::GMX_LOG, the whole statement evaluates to a conditional that reads the
log target from a member variable and compares it against `nullptr`.  All the
code that formats the output is skipped in this case.

All information written to the log is composed of _log entries_.  Each
::GMX_LOG statement writes a single log entry, meaning that newlines are
automatically added.

The logging methods are not thread-safe, so it is the responsibility of the
calling code to only use them from a single thread or otherwise synchronize
access.
