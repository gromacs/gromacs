Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix periodic boundary conditions in analysis framework tools
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

There was a bug in the trajectory analysis framework which caused
molecules that were broken over PBC not to be made whole. This would
usually lead to obviously incorrect outliers in analysis output.

:issue:`3900`

Fix range checking bug in gmx covar
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A check was inverted causing range checking to be applied wrong.

:issue:`3902`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed compilation on Cygwin
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A |Gromacs| header file was not including the necessary standard
header. A problem with the ``M_PI`` math constant defined only by
POSIX and not by C++ was also worked around.

:issue:`3890`

Improve grompp checks of AWH settings when sampling an FEP dimension
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Ensure that the AWH sampling interval is compatible with nstcalcenergy
when sampling an FEP dimension using AWH. This avoids crashes in the
first AWH sampling step (step > 0) if the settings were not correct.

:issue:`3922`

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
