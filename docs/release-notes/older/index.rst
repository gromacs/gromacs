Release notes for older |Gromacs| versions
==========================================

Unfortunately, resources are finite and many versions of |Gromacs| are
no longer actively maintained. This page records the release notes for
all such versions, so that users can find a record of the changes made
in all major and patch releases of |Gromacs|. Major releases contain
changes to the functionality supported, whereas patch releases contain
only fixes for issues identified in the corresponding major releases.

Where issue numbers are reported in these release notes, more details
can be found at https://gitlab.com/gromacs/gromacs/-/issues at that issue number.
