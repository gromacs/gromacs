GROMACS 2018.3 release notes
----------------------------

This version was released on TODO, 2018. These release notes document
the changes that have taken place in GROMACS since version 2018.2, to fix known
issues. It also incorporates all fixes made in version TODO and
earlier, which you can find described in the :ref:`release-notes`.

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multi-domain GPU runs can no longer miss pair interactions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
With systems with empty space in the unit cell, GPU runs with domain
decomposition would not compute LJ and Coulomb interactions between
domains when there we no interactions between domains on a rank at some
point in time. Although this could cause unnoticed errors in short runs,
most production length runs would become unstable when affected by this bug.

:issue:`2502`


Multi-domain Conjugate Gradient minimimization no longer segfaults.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`2554`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix bfactor output error caused by fix for :issue:`2511`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The fix for the PQR file output broke the output of bfactors from other tools.

:issue:`2575`

Made sure that gmx rms can skip values
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
When requested to skip values, gmx rms would still output all values despite
the option. Now it only outputs values that are requested to be processed.

:issue:`2565`

Fixes to improve portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous
