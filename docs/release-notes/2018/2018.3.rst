GROMACS 2018.3 release notes
----------------------------

This version was released on TODO, 2018. These release notes document
the changes that have taken place in GROMACS since version 2018.2, to fix known
issues. It also incorporates all fixes made in version TODO and
earlier, which you can find described in the :ref:`release-notes`.

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multi-domain GPU runs can no longer miss pair interactions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With systems with empty space in the unit cell, GPU runs with domain
decomposition would not compute LJ and Coulomb interactions between
domains when there we no interactions between domains on a rank at some
point in time. 

 - This bug only affects simulations running on GPUs with domain decomposition
   and containing empty regions of space that can lead to domains being empty.
 - Possible observations of this bug may have been seemingly random failures
   of calculations that where not reproducible when restarting a simulation
   from a checkpoint file, as the domain would then again be filled properly
   if interactions are present at the beginning.
 - It is unlikely that this bug will have unnoticed effects on all but
   very short simulations, as the missing interactions will inevitable lead
   to simulation instability and crashes.
 - If a simulation that crashed due to this bug is restarted it will contain
   a small region around the crash that will be unphysical due to some
   interactions not being calculated just before the crash itself.

**This is a critical fix and users that run on GPUs should update to this
point release**

:issue:`2502`


Multi-domain Conjugate Gradient minimimization no longer segfaults.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`2554`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix bfactor output error caused by fix for :issue:`2511`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The fix for the PQR file output broke the output of bfactors from other tools.

:issue:`2575`

Made sure that gmx rms can skip values
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
When requested to skip values, gmx rms would still output all values despite
the option. Now it only outputs values that are requested to be processed.

:issue:`2565`

Fixes to improve portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous
