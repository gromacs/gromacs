GROMACS 2018.3 release notes
----------------------------

This version was released on TODO, 2018. These release notes document
the changes that have taken place in GROMACS since version 2018.2, to fix known
issues. It also incorporates all fixes made in version TODO and
earlier, which you can find described in the :ref:`release-notes`.

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Multi-domain Conjugate Gradient minimimization no longer segfaults.

:issue:`2554`

Fix pairlist buffer with Brownian Dynamics
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With Brownian Dynamics and bd-fric > 0, the Verlet pairlist buffer would
be determined with incorrect masses for constrained atoms and virtual
sites. This would lead to a too small buffer for typical atomistic
systems with constraints.

:issue:`2613`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix bfactor output error caused by fix for :issue:`2511`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The fix for the PQR file output broke the output of bfactors from other tools.

:issue:`2575`

Made sure that gmx rms can skip values
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
When requested to skip values, gmx rms would still output all values despite
the option. Now it only outputs values that are requested to be processed.

:issue:`2565`

Fixes to improve portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
