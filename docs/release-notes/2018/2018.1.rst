GROMACS 2018.1 release notes
============================

This version was released on FIX ME WHEN RELEASING. These release
notes document the changes that have taken place in GROMACS since the
initial version 2018, to fix known issues. It also incorporates all
fixes made in version 2016.5.

Used SIMD bondeds without perturbed interactions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In free-energy calculations that lacked bonded interactions between
perturbed atom types, the SIMD-accelerated bonded functions were
inadvertently disabled. This has been enabled, which will improve
the performance of some kinds of free-energy calculations.

Fixed bonds whose displacement was zero
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We should allow overlapping atoms in harmonic bonds. But the former
code would cause a floating point exception and incorrect free-energy
derivatives.

Fixed centre-of-mass motion removal on part of the system
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMM removal requested for part of the system acted on the whole
system.

:issue:`2381`

Added check in grompp to avoid assertion failure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
With an mdp file with a parameter present with both the current name
and the old name which automatically gets replaced, an assertion
would fail. Now a fatal error is issued.

:issue:`2386`

Prevented log file energy average printing dividing by zero
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If very few simulation frames have computed energies, then there may
be insufficient data for averages. If so, skip the average printing
entirely.

:issue:`2394`

Correctly set cutoff modifiers in forcerec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The cutoff modifiers were not copied from interaction_const_t
to forcerec_t which meant only the generic kernels were used with
the group scheme. This fix will restore the performance of the
group scheme.

:issue:`2399`

Fixed box scaling in PME mixed mode using both GPU and CPU
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

:issue:`2385`

Re-enabled GPU support with walls and 1 energy group
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
With a single non-bonded energy group and walls, we can now use a GPU
for non-bonded calculations.

Removed tumbling ice-cube warning with SD integrator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
With SD, there is friction, so ice cubes will not tumble.

Fixed assertion failure in test-particle insertion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erroneous logic in the TPI meant that it always failed without producing
any result.

:issue:`2398`

Avoided mdrun echoing "No option -multi"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mdrun would print as many messages "No option -multi" as there
are MPI ranks to stderr.
Also updated -multi to -multidir in an error message.

:issue:`2377`

Used more portable python shebangs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Per https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/#recommendation, we
should use env, and point it at python2. When we either make them 2/3
or just-3 compatible, this should change.

Some distros (notably Arch Linux) already point python at python3 so
we should choose to be explicit, and thus somewhat portable.

:issue:`2401`

Added work-around for GCC 5.3 targetting AVX512 hardware
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
GCC 5.3 has bug in overload resolution causing the AVX512
and scalar function to become ambiguous.

Used isfinite unambiguously
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patch provdied by Veselin Kolev to quiet some compiler warnings.

:issue:`2400`
