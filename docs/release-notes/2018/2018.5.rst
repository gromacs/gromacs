Warn for problematic coupling times with Nose-Hoover and Parrinello-Rahman
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When combining the Nose-Hoover and Parrinello-Rahman coupling algorithms,
resonances in the kinetic energy and pressure/volume can appear when
the two coupling times involved are similar. Now grompp warns when ``tau-p``
is less than two times ``tau-t``.

:issue: `2749`
