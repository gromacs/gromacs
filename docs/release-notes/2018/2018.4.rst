GROMACS 2018.4 release notes
----------------------------

This version was released on TODO, 2018. These release notes document
the changes that have taken place in GROMACS since version 2018.3, to fix known
issues. It also incorporates all fixes made in version TODO and
earlier, which you can find described in the :ref:`release-notes`.

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Correct PME forces with free energy without perturbed charges/LJ
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With free-energies calculations with lambda not set to zero and no
actual perturbed charges or atom types for Lennard-Jones, the Coulomb
or LJ PME mesh forces would be scaled with lambda. Note that this bug
did not affect the, usual, setup where charges or atom types are actually
perturbed.

:issue: `2640`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix mindist output file checks
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

mindist would not check if the output file needed to print residue names and
residue contacts over time was actually defined, leading to errors with
empty file name strings.

:issue:`2653`


Fixes to improve portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed an issue where the log file could sometimes report an incorrect
initial dynamic load balancing state

:issue:`2631`
