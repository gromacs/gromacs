earlier, which you can find described in the :ref:`release-notes`.

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prevent OpenCL timing memory leak
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When using OpenCL builds and timing, a memory leak would lead to all system memory being used up.

:issue:`2470`

Fix MPI error after constraint failure during energy minimization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:issue:`2540`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed buffer overflow in grompp warnings
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
When grompp issued a warning or error with a filename/path of more than
255 characters, a buffer overflow would occur. This could also happens
during make check/test.

:issue:`2465`

Fix infinite loop in gmx solvate
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
When provided with a PDB file that had no box information for the solvent,
gmx solvate could be stuck in an infinite loop.
Fixed by disallowing empty boxes for solvent PDB files.

:issue:`2523`

Fixed enemat when the .edr file had no matching energy groups
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`2508`

Fix PQR file output
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
PQR files from gmx editconf violated the standard for the format because
they were always written in fixed format. This commit fixes the issue by
introducing a different output method for PQR files that follows the
standard.

:issue:`2511`

Fix crash in gmx solvate
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
gmx solvate would crash due to memory corruption when using multiple solvent
molecule types. This commit fixes the issue by properly freeing memory
associated.

Fixes to improve portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed CUDA compilation on Windows.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`2509`

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed inadvertent disabling of SIMD version of the integrator
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Fixed a bug so the SIMD version of the leap-frog integrator is chosen, when possible.

:issue:`2497`

Fix own FFTW builds on certain AVX2/AVX512 hardware
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Version 3.3.8 of FFTW fixes some known gcc-8 errors for AVX2 by removing the 
fast-math flag, and it also appears to fix an issue with failed unit tests on
AVX512-capable hardware, so we have bumped the version we download to 3.3.8.

:issue:`2541`
