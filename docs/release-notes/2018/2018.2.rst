Fix own FFTW builds on certain AVX2/AVX512 hardware
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Version 3.3.8 of FFTW fixes some known gcc-8 errors for AVX2 by removing the 
fast-math flag, and it also appears to fix an issue with failed unit tests on
AVX512-capable hardware, so we have bumped the version we download to 3.3.8.
