Fix incorrect LJ repulsion force switching on GPUs
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When using a CUDA or OpenCL GPU, the coefficient for the second order
term for the LJ repulsion in the force switching function, called 'A'
in the manual, had the wrong sign. This lead to very small errors in
the forces and the pressure. Note that the dispersion force switching
was correct. Although the effect on individual atoms pairs was negligible,
their combined effect on the pressure could lead to deformation of
CHARMM membrane systems, where LJ force switching is regularly applied.
