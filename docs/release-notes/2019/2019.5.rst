Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix use of uninitialized data on PME only ranks
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When building GPU enabled versions of |Gromacs| with clang as either host only or host
and device side compiler, PME datastructures could be left uninitialized, leading
to the use of random values for LJ PME energies, virial and pressure.

The effect of this bug was that the potential and total energy could
be wrong, but not the Coulomb mesh energy. This didn't affect sampling.
The pressure could also be wrong, which would affect sampling when pressure
coupling is used, but likely the simulation would explode after a few steps.

This doesn't seem to have affected versions of |Gromacs| built
with gcc as the host side compiler.

:issue:`3120`

Fix out of range memory access with free-energy calculations
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With free-energy calculations not using lambda states, an output
buffer would be accessed one element beyond it's allocated size.
We don't expect this to have caused incorrect results, but
a memory checker would complain.

:issue:`3173`

Work around broken Apple Clang compiler in Mac OS Catalina
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
In Mac OS Catalina, the default XCode compilers checks and
enforces stack alignment. This would have been a good idea
if Apple itself did not ship a C library that violates the
stack alignment with AVX instructions are enabled.
