Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix missing interactions with domain decomposition
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When running with domain decomposition, any interactions described by
the rarely-used topology file section
``[ intermolecular_interactions ]`` were ignored. This did not
affect normal non-bonded or intra-molecular interactions.

:issue:`2953`

Fix possible floating point exception during minimization.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

It was possible that very small forces during minimization could lead to
a crash due to a divide by zero error. Fixed by introducing a check.

:issue:`2917`

Fix segmentation fault when using membrane embedding
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`2947`

Allow AWH with pull-geometry 'direction' to be periodic
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When applying AWH to a pull coordinate with geometry 'direction'
with a AWH interval length of more than 95% of the box size,
the dimension is now made periodic.

:issue:`2946`
       
Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed residue and molecule indexing in selections
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`2951`

Fix PQR formatting
""""""""""""""""""""

The formatting was incorrect for some tools that use PQR files.

:issue:`2955`

Fix gmx wham with angle geometries
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

gmx wham would mix up degree and radian units leading to no overlap
or not-a-number output. **Note**: this fix is not correct, a correct
fix is applied in the next patch release.

:issue:`2609`
:issue:`3094`

Add some information for grompp error with wrong line endings
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Give meaningful error with too large grid in hbond
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When using a grid that is too large :ref:`hbond <gmx hbond>` could try to
allocate enough memory to cause a crash.

:issue:`2962`

Add some information for syntax errors with include delimiters in grompp
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`2911`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed wider reference SIMD setups
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The reference SIMD builds could use a too small memory alignment,
leading to mdrun exiting with an alignment error

:issue:`2952`

Fixed build failure with Apple Clang
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Builds would fail because of qsort being undefined.

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Removed non-existent mdp option awh1-dim1-period from user guide
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`2940`

Add checks for too many interactions during memory allocation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`2932`
