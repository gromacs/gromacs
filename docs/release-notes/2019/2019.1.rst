GROMACS 2019.1 release notes

This version was released on TODO, 2019. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in GROMACS since the

fixes made in version 2018.5 and earlier, which you can find described
in the :ref:`release-notes`.

Explicitly require 64-bit platforms for OpenCL
------------------------------------------------

A 64-bit OpenCL runtime is required by GROMACS.
All known OpenCL implementations on 64-bit platforms are 64-bit
(and there are no known 32-bit platforms with 64-bit OpenCL),
hence we require a 64-bit platform at configure-time in OpenCL builds.
A known unsupported 32-bit platform is ARMv7.

Miscellaneous
