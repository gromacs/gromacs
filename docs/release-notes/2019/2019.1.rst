GROMACS 2019.1 release notes
----------------------------

This version was released on TODO, 2019. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in GROMACS since the
initial version 2019, to fix known issues. It also incorporates all
fixes made in version 2018.5 and earlier, which you can find described
in the :ref:`release-notes`.

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix segmentation fault in mdrun with domain decomposition
---------------------------------------------------------

:issue: `2813`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix trjconv -ndec
---------------------------------------------------------

This only works for writing .xtc files. The code and documentation now
works correctly with .gro files, which was changed in 2016 release series so that
it would only write fixed-width columns.

:issue: `2813`
:issue: `2037`


Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Disabled OpenCL support with MSVC
---------------------------------
GROMACS requires MSVC 2017, and the GROMACS OpenCL build requires
clFFT. If clFFT is found on the user's system, then all may be well,
but the version of clFFT bundled within GROMACS cannot be built
because only MSVC 2010 is supported by clFFT at this time. A
configure-time fatal error is now issued in this case.

:issue: `2500`

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
