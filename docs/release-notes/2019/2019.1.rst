GROMACS 2019.1 release notes
----------------------------

This version was released on TODO, 2019. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in GROMACS since the
initial version 2019, to fix known issues. It also incorporates all
fixes made in version 2018.5 and earlier, which you can find described
in the :ref:`release-notes`.

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix error with 2D/3D dynamic load balancing
-------------------------------------------

With 2D or 3D domain decomposition with dynamics load balancing,
mdrun would exit with the error "The domain decomposition grid
as shifted too much .." when a cell size was limited.

:issue: `2830`

Fix incorrect LJ repulsion force switching on GPUs
--------------------------------------------------

When using a CUDA or OpenCL GPU, the coefficient for the second order
term for the LJ repulsion in the force and energy switching function,
called 'A' in the manual, had the wrong sign. Note that the dispersion
force switching was correct. Although the error this introduces in
the force is very small, the effect on the pressure could lead to
deformation of CHARMM membran systems, where LJ force switching is
regularly applied.

:issue" `2845`


Fix segmentation fault in mdrun with domain decomposition
---------------------------------------------------------

:issue: `2813`

Fix possible division by zero in enforced-rotation code
-------------------------------------------------------

:issue: `1431`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix trjconv -ndec
---------------------------------------------------------

This only works for writing .xtc files. The code and documentation now
works correctly with .gro files, which was changed in 2016 release series so that
it would only write fixed-width columns.

:issue: `2824`
:issue: `2037`


Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With MSVC, disabled internal clFFT fallback used for OpenCL support
-------------------------------------------------------------------
GROMACS requires MSVC 2017, and the GROMACS OpenCL build requires
clFFT. If clFFT is found on the user's system, then all may be well,
but the version of clFFT bundled within GROMACS cannot be built
because only MSVC 2010 is supported by clFFT at this time. A
configure-time fatal error is now issued in this case.

:issue: `2500`

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
