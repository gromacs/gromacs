Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PME tuning could exit with an assertion failure
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When using OpenMP threading and an unlucky combination of PME grid dimensions,
mdrun could exit during PME tuning with an assertion failure for gridSize.

:issue:`5406`
:issue:`5417`

Direct halo communication could cause mdrun to exit with an MPI error
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The direct halo communication in mdrun, which needs to be enabled by setting
an environment variable, could cause mdrun to stop with an MPI error.
This is very unlikely to have led to incorrect results.

:issue:`5418`
