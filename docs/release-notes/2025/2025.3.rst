mdrun reported double the number of domain decompositions when using GPUs
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When using GPUs, the cycle count table at the end of the log file reported a number of calls
for Domain decomp. that was too high by a factor of one plus the number of dimensions that
were decomposed. The times and cycle counts were correct.
