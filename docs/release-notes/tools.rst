Improvements to |Gromacs| tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added convert-trj
---------------------------------------
A new tool :ref:`convert-trj <gmx convert-trj>` has been added to allow
user to interchange trajectory formats in the new trajectoryanalysis framework.
It is part of the drive to split up the :ref:`trjconv <gmx trjconv>` tool
into smaller parts.
