New topology entry for distributed charges
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Is it now possible to use distributed charges as an alternative to point charges,
by providing a new entry with the distribution widths in the .top file. This new
method has been implemented for the CPU kernels and for Gaussian distributions only.
