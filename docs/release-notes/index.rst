Release notes
=============

These release notes record the changes made in all major and patch
releases of |Gromacs|. Major releases contain changes to the
functionality supported, whereas patch releases contain only fixes for
issues identified in the corresponding major releases.

Two versions of |Gromacs| are under active maintenance, the 2018
series and the 2016 series. In the latter, only highly conservative
fixes will be made, and only to address issues that affect scientific
correctness. Naturally, some of those releases will be made after the
year 2016 ends, but we keep 2016 in the name so users understand how
up to date their version is. Such fixes will also be incorporated into
the 2018 release series, as appropriate. Around the time the 2019
release is made, the 2016 series will no longer be maintained.

Where issue numbers are reported in these release notes, more details
can be found at https://redmine.gromacs.org at that issue number.
