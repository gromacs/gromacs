|Gromacs| 2023.1 release notes
------------------------------

This version was released on TODO, 2023. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in |Gromacs| since the
previous 2023 version, to fix known issues. It also incorporates all
fixes made in version 2022.5 and earlier, which you can find described
in the :ref:`release-notes`.

.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on GitLab, without
   a space between the colon and number!

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix checkpointing of expanded ensemble simulations with domain decomposition
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Expanded-ensemble simulations can now restart from a checkpoint when running
multiple PP ranks.

:issue:`4629`

Fix PME pipelining support in SYCL
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When PME pipelining was used, long-range PME electrostatics were producing
incorrect results in SYCL.

Only runs with >=3 GPUs and with direct GPU communication enabled
(``GMX_ENABLE_DIRECT_GPU_COMM`` env. var.) are affected.

:issue:`4733`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix crash in ``gmx solvate`` when using solvent box in PDB format
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Now a PDB file can be passed to the ``-cs`` option in ``gmx solvate``.
In previous releases (since at least 2016) this lead to a segfault.

Fix creating index file from another index file
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``gmx make_ndx`` can again accept an index file alone as input, without associated structure file.

:issue:`4717`

Allow selection of energy term by full name in ``gmx energy`` 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

It is now possible to select energy terms by full name. This is specifically helpful for terms starting
with a number, such as "1/Viscosity" or "2CosZ*Vel-X", which could previously only be selected reliably
by number.

:issue:`4739`


Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed abnormal termination during ``gmx`` startup
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

|Gromacs| made a call to ``std::filesystem::equivalent`` in a less than
perfectly robust manner. This caused ``gmx`` to stop execution
when linked against the (atypical) libc++ standard library when
the build directory no longer existed.

:issue:`4724`

Fixed CPU FFT with MKL 2023.0
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Previously, |Gromacs| would fail during the initialization of CPU FFT when it
was compiled with oneMKL 2023.0. This is fixed now.

:issue:`4691`


Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Workaround for strange compiler behavior to improve SYCL bonded kernel performance
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For some SYCL targets (most notably, hipSYCL for AMD GPUs with ROCm 5.x),
a very inefficient code was generated for bonded kernels.
Now, bonded force calculation on GPU is expected to be up to 3 times faster.
