.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on GitLab, without
   a space between the colon and number!

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix checkpointing of expanded ensemble simulations with domain decomposition
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Expanded-ensemble simulations can now restart from a checkpoint when running
multiple PP ranks.

:issue:`4629`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix crash in ``gmx solvate`` when using solvent box in PDB format
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Now a PDB file can be passed to the ``-cs`` option in ``gmx solvate``.
In previous releases (since at least 2016) this lead to a segfault.

Fix creating index file from another index file
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``gmx make_ndx`` can again accept an index file alone as input, without associated structure file.

:issue:`4717`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed abnormal termination during ``gmx`` startup
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

|Gromacs| made a call to ``std::filesystem::equivalent`` in a less than
perfectly robust manner. This caused ``gmx`` to stop execution
when linked against the (atypical) libc++ standard library when
the build directory no longer existed.

:issue:`4724`

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Workaround for strange compiler behavior to improve SYCL bonded kernel performance
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For some SYCL targets (most notably, hipSYCL for AMD GPUs with ROCm 5.x),
a very inefficient code was generated for bonded kernels.
Now, bonded force calculation on GPU is expected to be up to 3 times faster.

:issue:`3928`
