GROMACS 2022.2 release notes
----------------------------

This version was released on TODO, 2022. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in GROMACS since the
previous 2022.1 version, to fix known issues. It also incorporates all
fixes made in version 2021.5 and earlier, which you can find described
in the :ref:`release-notes`.

.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on GitLab, without the
   a space between the colon and number!

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix incorrect constraining in highly parallel runs
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With domain decomposition, OpenMP and connected constraints (so not only
bonds with hydrogens constrained), constraint correction could be applied
when a domain would not have any constraints while it had constraints before.
This is unlikely to have gone unnoticed in longer runs, as the chance is
high that atoms would clash and the system would become unstable. But short
runs might not crash and could therefore produce incorrect results. The correctness can
be judged from the drift in the conserved energy quantity, which is reported
at the end of the log file, and which will be one to two orders of magnitude
larger than for a correct run.

:issue:`4476`

Fix missing PME mesh dV/dlambda with PME on GPU on a seperate PME rank
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When doing free-energy calculations with PME running on GPU on a separate
PME rank, the dV/dlambda contribution for the PME mesh part was missing.
The same contribution was missing from the foreign lambda energy differences.
Note that the energies and forces were correct.

:issues;`4474`
Removed the (incorrect) output file size note/warning with mdrun -rerun
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`4484`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clarified pdb2gmx error message for undefined atom type in terminal database
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`4481`

Lower severity of grompp exclusion distance issues with energy minimization
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With energy minimization, the error/warning about pair distances
beyond/close to the cut-off has been changed to a warning/note,
as energy minimization might fix such issues.

:issue:`4480`

Fixed missing cmap torsion correction for periodic pepdites
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When using pdb2gmx with periodic peptides and the CHARMM27
force field, the CMAP correction across the periodic boundary
was missing (but not the torsion itself). Reprocess your
PDB file with pdb2gmx from version 2022.2 or later to get a
correct topology, or add it manually to the topology.

Fixes that affect portability
