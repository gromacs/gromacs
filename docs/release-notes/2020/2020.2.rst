.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on redmine, without the
   a space between the colon and number!

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ewald dipole correction incorrect without domain decomposition
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Ewald dipole correction (epsilon-surface != 0) is now disabled when not
using domain decomposition. With domain decomposition, it only works
when each molecule consists of a single update group (e.g. water).
This will be fixed in release-2021.

:issue:`3441`

Expanded ensemble simulations restarted from checkpoints
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When restarting expanded ensemble simulations from checkpoints, expanded
ensemble would silently refuse to run, and simulations would remain in
their original lambda state.

:issue:`3465`

Fixed free energy calculations with LJ PME
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Fixed an issue that calculated wrong long-range corrections when using
free energy perturbation with ``vdwtype = pme``. This affected forces,
energies, lambda derivatives and foreign lambdas.

:issue:`3470`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Time output unit fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When selecting a time unit of microseconds or larger,
``gmx tool -tu`` now produces the correct string in .xvg and
particularly .xvgr plots

Fix do_dssp
^^^^^^^^^^^

The tool would fail with a segmentation fault.

:issue:`3444`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed initial DLB state reporting
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The initial DLB state was reported incorrectly in the log file when
the either "on" or "auto" value was the chosen at mdrun startup.
