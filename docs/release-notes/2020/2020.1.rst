Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly

:issue:`3296`

Fix deadlock in mdrun runs with multiple ranks and separate PME ranks
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When multiple PP ranks as well as separate PME ranks are used, mdrun could
deadlock before starting the PP-PME balancing.

:issue:`3335`

Avoid mdrun assertion failure when running with shells and update on a GPU
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A check for shells has been added in the mdrun task assignment code,
so that mdrun falls back to CPU or produces a clear error message
when attempting to run with shells and update on a GPU.

:issue:`3303`

Allow large prime factors in the mdrun MPI rank count
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The domain decomposition would refuse to run with large prime factors
in the MPI rank count even when the grid was specified by the user.

Fixes that affect portability

Add support for ICC NextGen
