Changes anticipated to |Gromacs| 2020 functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Functionality deprecated in |Gromacs| 2020
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support for 32bit architectures
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
There are no current or planned large scale resources using 32bit architectures,
and we have no ability to properly test and evaluate them.

Free-energy soft-core power 48
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Free-energy soft-core power 48 is almost never used and is therefore deprecated.

Functionality deprecated in |Gromacs| 2019
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Generation of virtual sites to replace aromatic rings in standard residues
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
These are thought to produce artefacts under some circumstances
(unpublished results), were never well tested, are not widely used,
and we need to simplify pdb2gmx.

Benchmarking options only available with ``gmx benchmark``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Options such as ``-confout``, ``-resethway``, ``-resetstep`` are not
intended for use by regular mdrun users, so making them only available
with a dedicated tool is more clear. Also, this permits us to customize
defaults for e.g. writing files at the end of a simulation part in ways
that suit the respective mdrun and benchmark use cases, so ``-confout``
will no longer be required.

``gmx mdrun -nsteps``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The number of simulation steps described by the .tpr file can be
changed with ``gmx convert-tpr``, or altered in .mdp file before the
call to ``gmx grompp``. The convenience of this mdrun option was
outweighted by the doubtful quality of its implementation, no clear
record in the log file, and lack of maintenance.
