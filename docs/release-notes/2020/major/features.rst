Density-guided simulations
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Users can now apply additional forces from three dimensional reference
densities. These forces can be used to "fit" atoms into the densities by
increasing the similarity of a simulated density to the reference density.

Multiple protocols are available for how to calculate simulated densities
as well as how the similarity between a reference and a simulated density is
evaluated.

Virtual site on the line through two atoms at fixed distance
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This is use useful for e.g. halogens in the CHARMM force field.

:issue:`2451`

gmxapi Python support
"""""""""""""""""""""

Data flow driven simulation and analysis from Python is now available in a
default |Gromacs| installation when users install the *gmxapi* Python package.
See :ref:`gmxapi`.

New modular simulator
"""""""""""""""""""""

A new approach for how to combine individual calculation steps during a single simulation
step is introduced, with focus on extensibility and modularization. This simulator is the default
now for simulations using velocity-verlet in NVE, NVT (v-rescale thermostat only), NPT (v-rescale
thermostat and Parrinello-Rahman barostat only), or NPH (Parrinello-Rahman barostat only), with or
without free energy perturbation.
