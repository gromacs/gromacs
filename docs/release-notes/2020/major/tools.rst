energy split into four separate tools
-------------------------------------

The energy tool for analsys of energy files is split into four
separate
tools: one to print energies (called energy),
one to compute viscosity in a number of ways (called viscosity),
one to compute fluctuation properties such as compressibilty and
heat capacities (called fluctprops) and one to compute free energies
based on two energy files (called dhdl).
