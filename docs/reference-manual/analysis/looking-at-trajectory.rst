Looking at your trajectory

| Before analyzing your trajectory it is often informative to look at
  your trajectory first. |Gromacs| comes with a simple trajectory viewer
  :ref:`gmx view <gmx view>`; the advantage
  with this one is that it does not require OpenGL, which usually isn’t
  present on *e.g.* supercomputers. It is also possible to generate a
  hard-copy in Encapsulated Postscript format (see
  :numref:`Fig. %s <fig-ngmxdump>`). If you want a faster and more
  fancy viewer there are several programs that can read the |Gromacs|
  trajectory formats – have a look at our `webpage`_ for updated links.
