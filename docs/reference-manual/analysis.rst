Analysis
========

In this chapter different ways of analyzing your trajectory are
described. The names of the corresponding analysis programs are given.
Specific information on the in- and output of these programs can be
found in the tool documentation :ref:`here <gmx-cmdline>`.
The output files are often
produced as finished Grace/Xmgr graphs.

First, in sec.Â :ref:`usinggroups`, the group concept in analysis is
explained. :ref:`selections` explains a newer concept of dynamic
selections, which is currently supported by a few tools. Then, the
different analysis tools are presented.
