Exclusions and 1-4 Interactions.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Atoms within a molecule that are close by in the chain, *i.e.* atoms
that are covalently bonded, or linked by one or two atoms are called
*first neighbors, second neighbors* and *third neighbors*, respectively
(see :numref:`Fig. %s <fig-chain>`). Since the interactions of atom **i** with atoms
**i+1** and **i+2** are mainly quantum mechanical, they can not be
modeled by a Lennard-Jones potential. Instead it is assumed that these
interactions are adequately modeled by a harmonic bond term or
constraint (**i, i+1**) and a harmonic angle term (**i, i+2**). The
first and second neighbors (atoms **i+1** and **i+2**) are therefore
*excluded* from the Lennard-Jones interaction list of atom **i**; atoms
**i+1** and **i+2** are called *exclusions* of atom **i**.

.. _fig-chain:

   Atoms along an alkane chain.

For third neighbors, the normal Lennard-Jones repulsion is sometimes
still too strong, which means that when applied to a molecule, the
molecule would deform or break due to the internal strain. This is
especially the case for carbon-carbon interactions in a
*cis*-conformation (*e.g.* *cis*-butane). Therefore, for some of these
interactions, the Lennard-Jones repulsion has been reduced in the GROMOS
force field, which is implemented by keeping a separate list of 1-4 and
normal Lennard-Jones parameters. In other force fields, such as
OPLS \ :ref:`103 <refJorgensen88>`, the standard Lennard-Jones
parameters are reduced by a factor of two, but in that case also the
dispersion (r\ :math:`^{-6}`) and the Coulomb interaction are scaled.
|Gromacs| can use either of these methods.

Charge Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In principle, the force calculation in MD is an :math:`O(N^2)` problem.
Therefore, we apply a cut-off for non-bonded force (NBF) calculations;
only the particles within a certain distance of each other are
interacting. This reduces the cost to :math:`O(N)` (typically
:math:`100N` to :math:`200N`) of the NBF. It also introduces an error,
which is, in most cases, acceptable, except when applying the cut-off
implies the creation of charges, in which case you should consider using
the lattice sum methods provided by |Gromacs|.

Consider a water molecule interacting with another atom. If we would
apply a plain cut-off on an atom-atom basis we might include the
atom-oxygen interaction (with a charge of :math:`-0.82`) without the
compensating charge of the protons, and as a result, induce a large
dipole moment over the system. Therefore, we have to keep groups of
atoms with total charge 0 together. These groups are called *charge
groups*. Note that with a proper treatment of long-range electrostatics
(e.g. particle-mesh Ewald (sec. :ref:`pme`), keeping charge groups
together is not required.

Treatment of Cut-offs in the group scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|Gromacs| is quite flexible in treating cut-offs, which implies there can
be quite a number of parameters to set. These parameters are set in the
input file for grompp. There are two sort of parameters that affect the
cut-off interactions; you can select which type of interaction to use in
each case, and which cut-offs should be used in the neighbor searching.

For both Coulomb and van der Waals interactions there are interaction
type selectors (termed vdwtype and coulombtype) and two parameters, for
a total of six non-bonded interaction parameters. See the User Guide for
a complete description of these parameters.

In the group cut-off scheme, all of the interaction functions in
:numref:`Table %s <tab-funcparm>` require that neighbor searching be done with a
radius at least as large as the :math:`r_c` specified for the functional
form, because of the use of charge groups. The extra radius is typically
of the order of 0.25 nm (roughly the largest distance between two atoms
in a charge group plus the distance a charge group can diffuse within
neighbor list updates).

.. _virtualsites:

Virtual interaction sites
-------------------------

Virtual interaction sites (called dummy atoms in
|Gromacs| versions before 3.3) can be used in |Gromacs| in a number of ways.
We write the position of the virtual site :math:`\mathbf{r}_s` as a function
of the positions of other particles
:math:`\mathbf{r}`\ :math:`_i`: :math:`\mathbf{r}_s =
f(\mathbf{r}_1..\mathbf{r}_n)`. The virtual site, which may carry charge or be
involved in other interactions, can now be used in the force
calculation. The force acting on the virtual site must be redistributed
over the particles with mass in a consistent way. A good way to do this
can be found in ref. \ :ref:`104 <refBerendsen84b>`. We can write the
potential energy as:

.. math:: V = V(\mathbf{r}_s,\mathbf{r}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{r}_n) = V^*(\mathbf{r}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{r}_n)
          :label: eqnvsiteepot

The force on the particle :math:`i` is then:

.. math:: \mathbf{F}_i = -\frac{\partial V^*}{\partial \mathbf{r}_i} 
          = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial \mathbf{r}_i} - 
             \frac{\partial V}{\partial \mathbf{r}_s} 
             \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_s}{\partial \mathbf{r}_i}
          = \mathbf{F}_i^{direct} + \mathbf{F}_i
          :label: eqnvsiteforce

The first term is the normal force. The second term is the force on
particle :math:`i` due to the virtual site, which can be written in
tensor notation:

.. math::  \mathbf{F}_i = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
           {\displaystyle\frac{\partial x_s}{\partial x_i}} & {\displaystyle\frac{\partial y_s}{\partial x_i}} & {\displaystyle\frac{\partial z_s}{\partial x_i}} \\[1ex]
           {\displaystyle\frac{\partial x_s}{\partial y_i}} & {\displaystyle\frac{\partial y_s}{\partial y_i}} & {\displaystyle\frac{\partial z_s}{\partial y_i}} \\[1ex]
           {\displaystyle\frac{\partial x_s}{\partial z_i}} & {\displaystyle\frac{\partial y_s}{\partial z_i}} & {\displaystyle\frac{\partial z_s}{\partial z_i}} \end{array}\right]\mathbf{F}_{s}
           :label: eqnfvsite

where :math:`\mathbf{F}_{s}` is the force on the virtual site and
:math:`x_s`, :math:`y_s` and :math:`z_s` are the coordinates of the
virtual site. In this way, the total force and the total torque are
conserved \ :ref:`104 <refBerendsen84b>`.

The computation of the virial (:eq:`eqn. %s <eqnXi>`) is non-trivial when
virtual sites are used. Since the virial involves a summation over all
the atoms (rather than virtual sites), the forces must be redistributed
from the virtual sites to the atoms (using  :eq:`eqn. %s <eqnfvsite>`) *before*
computation of the virial. In some special cases where the forces on the
atoms can be written as a linear combination of the forces on the
virtual sites (types 2 and 3 below) there is no difference between
computing the virial before and after the redistribution of forces.
However, in the general case redistribution should be done first.

.. _fig-vsites:

.. figure:: plots/dummies.*
   :width: 15.00000cm

   The seven different types of virtual site construction. The
   constructing atoms are shown as black circles, the virtual sites in
   gray.

There are six ways to construct virtual sites from surrounding atoms in
|Gromacs|, which we classify by the number of constructing atoms. **Note**
that all site types mentioned can be constructed from types 3fd
(normalized, in-plane) and 3out (non-normalized, out of plane). However,
the amount of computation involved increases sharply along this list, so
we strongly recommended using the first adequate virtual site type that
will be sufficient for a certain purpose. :numref:`Fig. %s <fig-vsites>` depicts 6 of
the available virtual site constructions. The conceptually simplest
construction types are linear combinations:

.. math:: \mathbf{r}_s = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i \, \mathbf{r}_i
          :label: eqnvsitelincomb

The force is then redistributed using the same weights:

.. math:: \mathbf{F}_i = w_i \, \mathbf{F}_{s}
          :label: eqnvsitelincombforce

The types of virtual sites supported in |Gromacs| are given in the list
below. Constructing atoms in virtual sites can be virtual sites
themselves, but only if they are higher in the list, i.e. virtual sites
can be constructed from “particles” that are simpler virtual sites.

-  As a linear combination of two atoms
   (:numref:`Fig. %s <fig-vsites>` 2):

   .. math:: w_i = 1 - a ~,~~ w_j = a
             :label: eqnvsitelin2atom

-  In this case the virtual site is on the line through atoms :math:`i`
   and :math:`j`.

-  On the line through two atoms, with a fixed distance
   (:numref:`Fig. %s <fig-vsites>` 2fd):

   .. math:: \mathbf{r}_s ~=~ \mathbf{r}_i + a \frac{ \mathbf{r}_{ij} }
                                                  { | \mathbf{r}_{ij} | }
             :label: eqnvsite2fdatom

-  In this case the virtual site is on the line through the other two
   particles at a distance of :math:`|a|` from :math:`i`. The force on
   particles :math:`i` and :math:`j` due to the force on the virtual site
   can be computed as:

   .. math:: \begin{array}{lcr}
                     \mathbf{F}_i &=& \displaystyle \mathbf{F}_{s} - \gamma ( \mathbf{F}_{is} - \mathbf{p} ) \\[1ex]
                     \mathbf{F}_j &=& \displaystyle \gamma (\mathbf{F}_{s} - \mathbf{p})      \\[1ex]
                     \end{array}
                     ~\mbox{ where }~
                     \begin{array}{c}
             \displaystyle \gamma = \frac{a}{ | \mathbf{r}_{ij} | } \\[2ex]
             \displaystyle \mathbf{p} = \frac{ \mathbf{r}_{is} \cdot \mathbf{F}_{s} }
                                   { \mathbf{r}_{is} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{is} } \mathbf{r}_{is}
             \end{array}
             :label: eqnvsite2fdforce

-  As a linear combination of three atoms
   (:numref:`Fig. %s <fig-vsites>` 3):

   .. math:: w_i = 1 - a - b ~,~~ w_j = a ~,~~ w_k = b
             :label: eqnvsitelin3atom

-  In this case the virtual site is in the plane of the other three
   particles.

-  In the plane of three atoms, with a fixed distance
   (:numref:`Fig. %s <fig-vsites>` 3fd):

   .. math:: \mathbf{r}_s ~=~ \mathbf{r}_i + b \frac{  (1 - a) \mathbf{r}_{ij} + a \mathbf{r}_{jk}  }
                                                  { | (1 - a) \mathbf{r}_{ij} + a \mathbf{r}_{jk} | }
             :label: eqnvsiteplane3atom

-  In this case the virtual site is in the plane of the other three
   particles at a distance of :math:`|b|` from :math:`i`. The force on
   particles :math:`i`, :math:`j` and :math:`k` due to the force on the
   virtual site can be computed as:

   .. math:: \begin{array}{lcr}
                     \mathbf{F}_i &=& \displaystyle \mathbf{F}_{s} - \gamma ( \mathbf{F}_{is} - \mathbf{p} ) \\[1ex]
                     \mathbf{F}_j &=& \displaystyle (1-a)\gamma (\mathbf{F}_{s} - \mathbf{p})      \\[1ex]
                     \mathbf{F}_k &=& \displaystyle a \gamma (\mathbf{F}_{s} - \mathbf{p})         \\
                     \end{array}
                     ~\mbox{ where }~
                     \begin{array}{c}
             \displaystyle \gamma = \frac{b}{ | \mathbf{r}_{ij} + a \mathbf{r}_{jk} | } \\[2ex]
             \displaystyle \mathbf{p} = \frac{ \mathbf{r}_{is} \cdot \mathbf{F}_{s} }
                                   { \mathbf{r}_{is} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{is} } \mathbf{r}_{is}
             \end{array}
             :label: eqnvsiteplane3atomforce

-  In the plane of three atoms, with a fixed angle and
   distance (:numref:`Fig. %s <fig-vsites>` 3fad):

   .. math:: \mathbf{r}_s ~=~ \mathbf{r}_i +
             d \cos \theta \frac{\mathbf{r}_{ij}}{ | \mathbf{r}_{ij} | } +
             d \sin \theta \frac{\mathbf{r}_\perp}{ | \mathbf{r}_\perp | }
             ~\mbox{ where }~
             \mathbf{r}_\perp ~=~ \mathbf{r}_{jk} - 
             \frac{ \mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{jk} }
             { \mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{ij} }
             \mathbf{r}_{ij}
             :label: eqnvsite2fadF

-  In this case the virtual site is in the plane of the other three
   particles at a distance of :math:`|d|` from :math:`i` at an angle of
   :math:`\alpha` with :math:`\mathbf{r}_{ij}`. Atom
   :math:`k` defines the plane and the direction of the angle. **Note**
   that in this case :math:`b` and :math:`\alpha` must be specified,
   instead of :math:`a` and :math:`b` (see also sec. :ref:`vsitetop`).
   The force on particles :math:`i`, :math:`j` and :math:`k` due to the
   force on the virtual site can be computed as (with
   :math:`\mathbf{r}_\perp` as defined in
   :eq:`eqn. %s <eqnvsite2fadF>`):

   .. math:: \begin{array}{c}
                     \begin{array}{lclllll}

             :label: eqnvsite2fadFforce

-  As a non-linear combination of three atoms, out of
   plane (:numref:`Fig. %s <fig-vsites>` 3out):

   .. math:: \mathbf{r}_s ~=~ \mathbf{r}_i + a \mathbf{r}_{ij} + b \mathbf{r}_{ik} +

             :label: eqnvsitenonlin3atom

-  This enables the construction of virtual sites out of the plane of
   the other atoms. The force on particles :math:`i,j` and :math:`k` due
   to the force on the virtual site can be computed as:

   .. math:: \begin{array}{lcl}

             \end{array}\right]\mathbf{F}_{s}                                 \\
             \mathbf{F}_i &=& \mathbf{F}_{s} - \mathbf{F}_j - \mathbf{F}_k
             \end{array}
             :label: eqnvsitenonlin3atomforce

-  From four atoms, with a fixed distance, see
   separate :numref:`Fig. %s <fig-vsite4fdn>`. This construction is a bit complex,
   in particular since the previous type (4fd) could be unstable which
   forced us to introduce a more elaborate construction:

.. _fig-vsite4fdn:

.. figure:: plots/vsite-4fdn.*
      :width: 5.00000cm

      The new 4fdn virtual site construction, which is stable even when
      all constructing atoms are in the same plane.

                  \mathbf{r}_{ja} &=& a\, \mathbf{r}_{ik} - \mathbf{r}_{ij} = a\, (\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}_i) - (\mathbf{x}_j - \mathbf{x}_i) \nonumber \\
                  \mathbf{r}_{jb} &=& b\, \mathbf{r}_{il} - \mathbf{r}_{ij} = b\, (\mathbf{x}_l - \mathbf{x}_i) - (\mathbf{x}_j - \mathbf{x}_i) \nonumber \\

                  :label: eqnvsite

-  In this case the virtual site is at a distance of :math:`|c|` from
   :math:`i`, while :math:`a` and :math:`b` are parameters. **Note**
   that the vectors :math:`\mathbf{r}_{ik}` and :math:`\mathbf{r}_{ij}`
   are not normalized to save floating-point operations. The force on
   particles :math:`i`, :math:`j`, :math:`k` and :math:`l` due to the
   force on the virtual site are computed through chain rule derivatives
   of the construction expression. This is exact and conserves energy,
   but it does lead to relatively lengthy expressions that we do not
   include here (over 200 floating-point operations). The interested
   reader can look at the source code in ``vsite.c``. Fortunately, this
   vsite type is normally only used for chiral centers such as
   :math:`C_{\alpha}` atoms in proteins.

   The new 4fdn construct is identified with a ‘type’ value of 2 in the
   topology. The earlier 4fd type is still supported internally (‘type’
   value 1), but it should not be used for new simulations. All current
   |Gromacs| tools will automatically generate type 4fdn instead.

-  A linear combination of :math:`N` atoms with relative
   weights :math:`a_i`. The weight for atom :math:`i` is:

   .. math:: w_i = a_i \left(\sum_{j=1}^N a_j \right)^{-1}
             :label: eqnvsiterelweight

-   There are three options for setting the weights:

   -  center of geometry: equal weights

   -  center of mass: :math:`a_i` is the mass of atom :math:`i`; when in
      free-energy simulations the mass of the atom is changed, only the
      mass of the A-state is used for the weight

   -  center of weights: :math:`a_i` is defined by the user
