This manual is not complete and has no pretension to be so due
to lack of time of the contributors -- our first priority is to improve
the software. It is worked on continuously,
which in some cases might mean the information is not entirely correct.

Comments on form and content are welcome, please send them to the
`user discussion forum`_ or the `developer discussion forum`_
(see our `webpage`_ or this section on
how to :ref:`contribute <gmx-contribute>`), or open an issue
on our `issue tracker`_. Corrections can also be made in the |Gromacs| git
source repository and uploaded to the |Gromacs| `GitLab`_.

We release an updated version of the manual whenever
we release a new version of the software, so in general 
it is a good idea to use a manual with the same major and
minor release number as your |Gromacs| installation.
