Free energy implementation
--------------------------

For free energy calculations, there are two things that must be
specified; the end states, and the pathway connecting the end states.
The end states can be specified in two ways. The most straightforward is
through the specification of end states in the topology file. Most
potential forms support both an :math:`A` state and a :math:`B` state.
Whenever both states are specified, the :math:`A` state corresponds
to the initial free energy state, and the :math:`B` state corresponds to
the final state.

In some cases, the end state can also be defined in some cases without
altering the topology, solely through the :ref:`mdp` file,
through the use of the
``couple-moltype``,
``couple-lambda0``,
``couple-lambda1``, and ``couple-intramol`` :ref:`mdp`
keywords. Any molecule type selected in ``couple-moltype``
will automatically have a :math:`B` state implicitly constructed (and
the :math:`A` state redefined) according to the
``couple-lambda`` keywords. ``couple-lambda0``
and ``couple-lambda1`` define the non-bonded parameters that
are present in the :math:`A` state (``couple-lambda0``) and
the :math:`B` state (``couple-lambda1``). The choices are
``q``,
``vdw``, and ``vdw-q``; these indicate the Coulombic, van der Waals, or
both parameters that are turned on in the respective state.

Once the end states are defined, then the path between the end states
has to be defined. This path is defined solely in the .mdp file.
Starting in 4.6, :math:`\lambda` is a vector of components, with
Coulombic, van der Waals, bonded, restraint, and mass components all
able to be adjusted independently. This makes it possible to turn off
the Coulombic term linearly, and then the van der Waals using soft core,
all in the same simulation. This is especially useful for replica
exchange or expanded ensemble simulations, where it is important to
sample all the way from interacting to non-interacting states in the
same simulation to improve sampling.

``fep-lambdas`` is the default array of :math:`\lambda`
values ranging from 0 to 1. All of the other lambda arrays use the
values in this array if they are not specified. The previous behavior,
where the pathway is controlled by a single :math:`\lambda` variable,
can be preserved by using only ``fep-lambdas`` to define the
pathway.

For example, if you wanted to first to change the Coulombic terms, then
the van der Waals terms, changing bonded at the same time rate as the
van der Waals, but changing the restraints throughout the first
two-thirds of the simulation, then you could use this :math:`\lambda`
vector:

::

    coul-lambdas           = 0.0 0.2 0.5 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0
    vdw-lambdas            = 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 1.0
    bonded-lambdas         = 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 1.0
    restraint-lambdas      = 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.5 0.7 1.0 1.0 1.0

This is also equivalent to:

::

    fep-lambdas            = 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 1.0
    coul-lambdas           = 0.0 0.2 0.5 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0
    restraint-lambdas      = 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.5 0.7 1.0 1.0 1.0

The ``fep-lambda`` array, in this case, is being used as the
default to fill in the bonded and van der Waals :math:`\lambda` arrays.
Usually, it’s best to fill in all arrays explicitly, just to make sure
things are properly assigned.

If you want to turn on only restraints going from :math:`A` to
:math:`B`, then it would be:

::

    restraint-lambdas      = 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.6 1.0

and all of the other components of the :math:`\lambda` vector would be
left in the :math:`A` state.

To compute free energies with a vector :math:`\lambda` using
thermodynamic integration, then the TI equation becomes vector equation:

.. math:: \Delta F = \int \langle \nabla H \rangle \cdot d\vec{\lambda}
          :label: eqnfepti

or for finite differences:

.. math:: \Delta F \approx \int \sum \langle \nabla H \rangle \cdot \Delta\lambda
          :label: eqnfepfinitediff

The external `pymbar script <https://SimTK.org/home/pymbar>`_
can compute this integral automatically
from the |Gromacs| ``dhdl.xvg`` output.

Potential of mean force
-----------------------

A potential of mean force (PMF) is a potential that is obtained by
integrating the mean force from an ensemble of configurations. In
|Gromacs|, there are several different methods to calculate the mean
force. Each method has its limitations, which are listed below.

-  **pull code:** between the centers of mass of molecules or groups of
   molecules.

-  **AWH code:** currently acts on coordinates provided by the pull
   code.

-  **free-energy code with harmonic bonds or constraints:** between
   single atoms.

-  **free-energy code with position restraints:** changing the
   conformation of a relatively immobile group of atoms.

-  **pull code in limited cases:** between groups of atoms that are part
   of a larger molecule for which the bonds are constrained with SHAKE
   or LINCS. If the pull group if relatively large, the pull code can be
   used.

The pull and free-energy code a described in more detail in the
following two sections.

Entropic effects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a distance between two atoms or the centers of mass of two groups
is constrained or restrained, there will be a purely entropic
contribution to the PMF due to the rotation of the two
groups \ :ref:`134 <refRMNeumann1980a>`. For a system of two
non-interacting masses the potential of mean force is:

.. math:: V_{pmf}(r) = -(n_c - 1) k_B T \log(r)
          :label: eqnfepentropy

where :math:`n_c` is the number of dimensions in which the constraint
works (i.e. :math:`n_c=3` for a normal constraint and :math:`n_c=1` when
only the :math:`z`-direction is constrained). Whether one needs to
correct for this contribution depends on what the PMF should represent.
When one wants to pull a substrate into a protein, this entropic term
indeed contributes to the work to get the substrate into the protein.
But when calculating a PMF between two solutes in a solvent, for the
purpose of simulating without solvent, the entropic contribution should
be removed. **Note** that this term can be significant; when at 300K the
distance is halved, the contribution is 3.5 kJ mol\ :math:`^{-1}`.
