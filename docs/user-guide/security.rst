Security when using |Gromacs|
=============================

.. _gmx-security:

We advise the users of |Gromacs| to be careful when using |Gromacs|
with files obtained from an unknown source (e.g. the Internet).

We cannot guarantee that the program won't crash with serious errors
that could cause execution of code with the same privileges as |Gromacs|
and e.g. delete the contents of your home directory..

Files that the user has created themselves don't carry those risks, but may
still misbehave and crash or consume large amounts of resources upon
malformed input.

Run input files obtained from outside sources should be treated with the
same caution as an executable file from the same source.
