Security when using |Gromacs|
=============================

.. _gmx-security:

We advise the users of |Gromacs| to be careful when using |Gromacs|
with files obtained from an unknown source (e.g. the Internet).

We cannot guarantee that the program won't crash with serious errors
that could cause execution of code with the same privileges as |Gromacs|.

This is not an issue with locally generated files that have been created by the users
themselves. Run input files obtained from other sources should be treated with the
same caution as an executable file from the same source.
