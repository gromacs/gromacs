Command-line tools
==================

|Gromacs| includes many tools for preparing, running and analysing
molecular dynamics simulations. These are all structured as part of the
gmx wrapper binary, and invoked with commands like :ref:`gmx grompp`.
:ref:`mdrun <gmx mdrun>` is the only other binary that
:ref:`can be built <building just the mdrun binary>`; in the normal
build it can be run with ``gmx mdrun``. Documentation for these can
be found at the links below:

   :glob:

Common options and behaviour
----------------------------

Optional files are not used unless the option is set, in contrast to
non-optional files, where the default file name is used when the option is
not set.

All |Gromacs| tools will accept file options without a file extension or
filename being specified. In such cases the default filenames will be
used. With multiple input file types, such as generic structure format,
the directory will be searched for files of each type with the supplied
or default name. When no such file is found, or with output files the
first file type will be used.

All |Gromacs| tools check if the command line options are valid. If this
is not the case, the program will be halted.

All |Gromacs| tools have 3 hidden options:

+-------------------+--------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| option            | type   | default       | description                                     |
+===================+========+===============+=================================================+
| ``-[no]hidden``   | bool   | \[``yes``\]   | \[hidden\] Print description for hidden options |
+-------------------+--------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| ``-[no]quiet``    | bool   | \[``no``\]    | \[hidden\] Do not print help info               |
+-------------------+--------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| ``-[no]debug``    | bool   | \[``no``\]    | \[hidden\] Write file with debug information    |
+-------------------+--------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------+

Many tools accept enumerated options (enum), which should be used with
one of the arguments listed in the option description. The argument may
be abbreviated, and the first match to the shortest argument in the list
will be selected.

Many tools also use options that may accept a vector of values. Either 1
or 3 parameters can be supplied; when only one parameter is supplied the
two other values are also set to this value.

All |Gromacs| tools can read compressed (``*.Z``) or g-zipped (``*.gz``)
files. There might be a problem with reading compressed [.tng] or [.xtc]
files, but these will not compress very well anyway.

Most |Gromacs| tools can process a trajectory with fewer atoms than the
run input or structure file, but only if the trajectory consists of the
first n atoms of the run input or structure file.
