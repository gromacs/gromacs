Known issues affecting users of |Gromacs|
=========================================

.. _gmx-users-known-issues:

Here is a non-exhaustive list of issues that are we are aware of that are
affecting regular users of |Gromacs|.

"Cannot find a working standard library" error with ROCm Clang
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some Clang installations don't contain a compatible C++ standard library.
In such cases, you might have to install ``g++`` and help CMake find it
by setting ``-DGMX_GPLUSGPLUS_PATH=/path/to/bin/g++``.

On Ubuntu 22.04, installing GCC 12 standard library (with 
``sudo apt install libstdc++-12-dev``) usually works well even without
setting ``-DGMX_GPLUSGPLUS_PATH``.

:issue:`4679`

Expanded ensemble does not checkpoint correctly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the legacy simulator, because of shortcomings in the
implementation, successful expanded-ensemble MC steps that occurred on
checkpoint steps were not recorded in the checkpoint. If that
checkpoint was used for a restart, then it would not necessarily
behave correctly and reproducibly afterwards. So checkpointing of
expanded-ensemble simulations is disabled for the legacy simulator.

Checkpointing of expanded ensemble in the modular simulator works
correctly.

To work around the issue, either avoid ``-update gpu`` (so that it
uses the modular simulator path which does not have
the bug), or use an older version of |Gromacs|
(which does do the buggy checkpointing), or refrain from
restarting from checkpoints in the affected case.

Compiling with GCC 12 on POWER9 architectures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are multiple failing unit tests after compilation with GCC 12.2
and 12.3 on POWER9 architectures. It is possible that other GCC 12 and
newer versions are affected.

:issue:`4823`

Launching multiple instances of GROMACS on the same machine with AMD GPUs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When |Gromacs| is built with AdaptiveCpp 23.10 or earlier for AMD GPUs,
launching more than 4 instances of |Gromacs| (even on different GPUs)
can lead to reduced performance.

The issue is completely avoided when each process is limited to a single
GPU using ``ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` environment variable. This is already
the recommended setting on some of the relevant supercomputers.

Building with AdaptiveCpp 24.02 also prevents the problem from arising.

:issue:`4965`

NbnxmTest crash with oneAPI 2024.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When building with oneAPI 2024.1, the ``NbnxmTest`` test can segfault in
some cases. Using oneAPI 2024.2 or newer should resolve the issue.

:issue:`5247`

Severe performance regression with SVE and LLVM 20
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a major performance regression on AArch64 CPUs
when using SVE SIMD and building with LLVM 20.

The problem can be worked around by using LLVM 19
or setting ``-DGMX_SIMD=ARM_NEON_ASIMD``.

The issue is expected to be fixed in LLVM 21.
