For those just starting out with |Gromacs| and / or :ref:`Molecular Dynamics Simulations <gmx-md>` it can be very daunting.
It is highly recommended that the various and extensive documentation that has been made available for |Gromacs|
is read first, plus papers published in the area of interest.

Resources
^^^^^^^^^

* |Gromacs| :doc:`/reference-manual/index/` - very detailed document that can also act as a very good introduction for :ref:`MD <gmx-md>` in general.
* :doc:`Flow Chart </user-guide/flow>`- simple flow chart of a typical |Gromacs| MD run of a protein in a box of water.
* Molecular dynamics simulations and GROMACS introduction
