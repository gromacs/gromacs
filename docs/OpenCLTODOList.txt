1. CODE IMPROVEMENTS
   =================
- Errors returned by OpenCL functions are handled by using assert calls. This
  needs to be improved.
  See also Issue #6 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/6

- calc_nb_kernel_nblock validates any nwork_units input value. The implementation
  needs to be updated to consider the maximum nwork_units accepted by the device.
  See also Issue #12 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/12
  
- clCreateBuffer is always called with CL_MEM_READ_WRITE flag. This needs to be
  updated so that only the flags that reflect how the buffer is used are provided.
  For example, if the device is only going to read from a buffer,
  CL_MEM_READ_ONLY should be used.
  See also Issue #13 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/13
  
- The data structures shared between the OpenCL host and device are defined twice:
  once in the host code, once in the device code. They must be moved to a single
  file and shared between the host and the device.
  See also Issue #16 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/16
  
- The size of one element of an OpenCL buffer cannot be computed by calling
  sizeof(buffer[0]). This needs to be accounted for to ensure memory allocations
  and memory copies correctly compute the buffer size.
  See also Issue #17 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/17
  
- Command queue synchronization using memory polling is never enabled for OpenCL devices.
  See also Issue #51 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/51
  
- Generating binary cache has a potential race condition in Multiple GPU runs
  See also Issue #71 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/71
  
- Caching for OpenCL builds should detect when a rebuild is necessary
  See also Issue #72 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/72

2. ENHANCEMENTS
   ============
- Implement OpenCL kernels for Intel GPUs

- Implement OpenCL kernels for Intel CPUs

- Improve GPU device sorting in detect_gpus
  See also Issue #64 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/64
  
- Implement warp independent kernels
  See also Issue #66 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/66
  
- Improve the way the path to the OpenCL kernel files is determined
  See also Issue #75 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/75
  
- Have one OpenCL program object per OpenCL kernel
  See also Issue #86 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/86

3. OPTIMIZATIONS
   =============
- Defining nbparam fields as constants when building the OpenCL kernels
  See also Issue #87 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/87
  
- Fix the tabulated Ewald kernel. This has the potential of being faster than
  the analytical Ewald kernel
  See also Issue #65 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/65
  
- Evaluate gpu_min_ci_balanced_factor impact on performance for AMD
  See also Issue #69: https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/69

4. OTHER NOTES
   ===========
- NVIDIA GPUs are not handled differently depending on compute capability

- Because the tabulated kernels have a bug not yet fixed, the current
  implementation uses only the analytical kernels and never the tabulated ones
  See also Issue #65 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/65

- Unlike the CUDA version, the OpenCL implementation uses normal buffers
  instead of textures
  See also Issue #88 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/88
