1. KNOWN LIMITATIONS
   =================
- Sharing an OpenCL GPU between two MPI ranks is not supported.
  See also Issue #91 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/91

- Using more than one OpenCL GPU on a node is thought to work with thread-MPI,
  and is known to segfault with AMD OpenCL and OpenMPI on x86 and Linux.

2. CODE IMPROVEMENTS
   =================
- Errors returned by OpenCL functions are handled by using assert calls. This
  needs to be improved.
  See also Issue #6 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/6

- clCreateBuffer is always called with CL_MEM_READ_WRITE flag. This needs to be
  updated so that only the flags that reflect how the buffer is used are provided.
  For example, if the device is only going to read from a buffer,
  CL_MEM_READ_ONLY should be used.
  See also Issue #13 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/13

- The data structures shared between the OpenCL host and device are defined twice:
  once in the host code, once in the device code. They must be moved to a single
  file and shared between the host and the device.
  See also Issue #16 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/16

- Quite a few error conditions are unhandled, noted with TODOs in several files

- gmx_device_info_t needs struct field documentation

3. ENHANCEMENTS
   ============
- Implement OpenCL kernels for Intel GPUs

- Implement OpenCL kernels for Intel CPUs

- Improve GPU device sorting in detect_gpus
  See also Issue #64 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/64

- Implement warp independent kernels
  See also Issue #66 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/66

- Have one OpenCL program object per OpenCL kernel
  See also Issue #86 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/86

- Consider parallelising JIT of programs over CPU cores to improve startup
  time

- Re-consider caching JIT artefacts to improve startup time

4. OPTIMIZATIONS
   =============
- Defining nbparam fields as constants when building the OpenCL kernels
  See also Issue #87 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/87

- Fix the tabulated Ewald kernel. This has the potential of being faster than
  the analytical Ewald kernel
  See also Issue #65 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/65

- Evaluate gpu_min_ci_balanced_factor impact on performance for AMD
  See also Issue #69: https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/69

- Update ocl_pmalloc to allocate page locked memory
  See also Issue #90: https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/90

- Update kernel for 128/256threads/block
  See also Issue #92: https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/92

- Update the kernels to use OpenCL 2.0 workgroup level functions if they prove
  to bring a significant speedup.
  See also Issue #93: https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/93

- Update the kernels to use fixed precision accumulation for force and energy
  values, if this implementation is faster and does not affect precision.
  See also Issue #94: https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/94

5. OTHER NOTES
   ===========
- NVIDIA GPUs are not handled differently depending on compute capability

- Because the tabulated kernels have a bug not yet fixed, the current
  implementation uses only the analytical kernels and never the tabulated ones
  See also Issue #65 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/65

- Unlike the CUDA version, the OpenCL implementation uses normal buffers
  instead of textures
  See also Issue #88 - https://github.com/StreamComputing/gromacs/issues/88
