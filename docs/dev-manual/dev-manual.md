Developer manual {#page_devmanual}
================

This set of pages contains guidelines, instructions, and explanations related
to \Gromacs development.  The actual code is documented in other parts of this
Doxygen documentation.

The focus is (at least for now) on things that are tightly tied to the code
itself, such as helper scripts that reside in the source repository, and may
require the documentation to be updated in sync.  Wiki pages at
<http://www.gromacs.org/Developer_Zone> contain additional information (much of
it outdated, though), and can be linked from relevant locations in this guide.

 - \subpage page_devtools <br/>
   Documentation for tools used

 - \subpage page_devstyle <br/>
   Guidelines to follow when writing new code. For some of the guidelines,
   scripts exist (see \ref page_devtools) to automatically reformat the code
   and/or enforce the guidelines for each commit.
