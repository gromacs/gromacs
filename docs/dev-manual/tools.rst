Development-time tools
======================

Several tools have their own individual pages and are listed below.

   doxygen
   change-management
   jenkins
   releng/index

   code-formatting

.. TODO: Consider what is the most reasonable structure; currently, this list
   here does not make much sense in the overall organization and creates a
   confusing TOC for the developer guide.

.. TODO: Add details for most of the tools, either in the form of links to wiki,
   or to a separate page that explains more details.

Change management
-----------------

|Gromacs| change management is supported by the following tools.
(For change submission guidelines, refer to :doc:`contribute`.)

git
  |Gromacs| uses `git <https://git-scm.com/>`__ as the version control system.
  Instructions for setting up git for |Gromacs|, as well as tips and tricks for
  its use, can be found in :doc:`change-management`.

  Other basic tutorial material for ``git`` can be found on the `web <https://git-scm.com/doc/ext>`__.

Gerrit
  All code changes go through a code review system at
  http://gerrit.gromacs.org.

Jenkins
  All changes pushed to Gerrit are automatically compiled and otherwise
  checked on various platforms using a continuous integration system at
  http://jenkins.gromacs.org.
  :doc:`jenkins` documents how Jenkins interacts with the build system,
  providing information on how to replicate the builds Jenkins does (e.g., to
  diagnose issues).
  :doc:`releng/index` provides more information on the technical implementation
  of the builds.

Redmine
  Bugs and issues, as well as some random features and discussions,
  are tracked at http://redmine.gromacs.org.

Build system
------------

.. TODO: details, ASAN, others?

CMake
  Main tool used in the build system.

packaging for distribution (CPack)

unit testing (CTest)
  |Gromacs| uses a unit testing framework based on Google C++ Testing
  Framework (gtest) and CTest.  All unit tests are automatically run on Jenkins
  for each commit.
  Details can be found on a separate page on :doc:`testutils`.

clang static analyzer

coverage

regression tests

Code formatting and style
-------------------------

The tools and scripts listed below are used to automatically check/apply
formatting that follows |Gromacs| style guidelines described on a separate page:
:doc:`style`.

uncrustify
  `uncrustify <http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net>`_ is used for automatic
  indentation and other formatting of the source code to follow
  :doc:`formatting`.  All code must remain invariant under uncrustify
  with the config at ``admin/uncrustify.cfg``.  A patched version of uncrustify is
  used.  See :ref:`gmx-uncrustify` for details.

clang-format
  We use clang-format to enforce a consistent coding style, with the
  settings recorded in ``.clang-format`` in the main tree.
  See :ref:`gmx-clang-format` for details.

``admin/copyright.py``
  This Python script adds and formats copyright headers in source files.
  ``copyright.sh`` (see below) uses the script to check/update copyright years on
  changed files automatically.

``admin/uncrustify.sh``
  This ``bash`` script runs uncrustify for all
  files that have local changes and checks that they conform to the prescribed
  style.  Optionally, the script can also apply changes to make the files
  conform. It is included only for historical reasons.
  See :doc:`formatting` for details.

``admin/copyright.sh``
  This ``bash`` script runs the ``copyright.py`` python script to enforce
  correct copyright information in all files that have local changes
  and checks that they conform to the prescribed
  style.  Optionally, the script can also apply changes to make the files
  conform.
  This script is automatically run by Jenkins to ensure that all commits adhere
  to :doc:`formatting`.  If the copyright job does not succeed, it
  means that this script has something to complain.
  See :doc:`code-formatting` for details.

``admin/clang-format.sh``
  This script enforces coding style using clang-format.
  This script is automatically run by Jenkins to ensure that all commits adhere
  to :doc:`formatting`.

``admin/git-pre-commit``
  This sample git pre-commit hook can be used if one wants to apply
  ``uncrustify.sh`` automatically before every commit to check for formatting
  issues.  See :doc:`code-formatting` for details.

``docs/doxygen/includesorter.py``
  This Python script sorts and reformats #include directives according to
  the guidelines at :doc:`includestyle`.  Details are documented on a
  separate page (with the whole suite of Python scripts used for source code
  checks): :ref:`dev-include-sorter`.

include directive checker
  In its present form, the above include sorter script cannot be conveniently
  applied in ``uncrustify.sh``.  To check for issues, it is instead integrated into
  a ``check-source`` build target.  When this target is built, it also checks for
  include formatting issues.  Internally, it uses the sorter script.  This check
  is run in Jenkins as part of the Documentation job.
  Details for the checking mechanism are on a separate page (common for several
  checkers): :doc:`gmxtree`.

``admin/reformat_all.sh``
  This ``bash`` script runs uncrustify/clang-format/``copyright.py``/include sorter
  on all relevant files in the source tree (or in a particular directory).
  The script can also produce the list of files where these scripts are applied,
  for use with other scripts.  See :doc:`code-formatting` for details.

git attributes
  git attributes (specified in ``.gitattributes`` files) are used to annotate
  which files are subject to automatic formatting checks (and for automatic
  reformatting by the above scripts).  See ``man gitattributes`` for an overview of
  the mechanism.  We use the ``filter`` attribute to specify the type of automatic
  checking/formatting to apply.  Custom attributes are used for specifying some
  build system dependencies for easier processing in CMake.
