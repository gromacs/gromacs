Release engineering with Gitlab
===============================

.. toctree::
   :hidden:

We are currently switching our build and testing system to use Gitlab
and the integrated CI system, with information for the general system found
at `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/`_. The new configuration for
the builds and tests can be found in the file ``.gitlab-ci.yml``, with
the templates for configuring is found in the files in the
``admin/ci-templates/`` directory. This section is going to be extended
with individual build information as it comes available. For now we are
using a combination of building with the previous system on Jenkins
and post-submit verification on Gitlab.

.. _releng-triggering-builds:

Triggering builds on Gitlab
---------------------------

Pipelines can be triggered through the web interface, with different
pipelines available through the use of specified environment variables
in the trigger interface.

This section is going to be extended with information for how to trigger
different builds and their individual behaviour.
