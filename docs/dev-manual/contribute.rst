Contribute to |Gromacs|
=======================

Please read this part first when you plan to contribute new functionality
to |Gromacs|, to make sure neither your nor our time is wasted.

Checklist
---------

When you plan to send in your code, please make sure that **all** the
points on this list have been fulfilled before you send in your code to review:

* Usefulness: Your code should have wide applicability within the scientific
  community. You are welcome to have smaller projects tracking our code,
  but we are not prepared to include and maintain code that will only have 
  limited application.

* Verifiable: If you propose a new method that passes the first check,
  please make sure that we can easily verify that it will be correct
  from a physics point of view.

* Coding style: Please make sure that your code follows **all** the
  :ref:`coding style guidelines <gmx-style-guidelines>`. This will make
  the code review less painful for either side.


.. TODO add more points here to make things clear

If you have questions regarding those points, please feel free to contact 
one of the |Gromacs| developers to clarify issues. Once we have decided that
that your code would be of use for |Gromacs|, we will then assist you in the
process of including it in the main source tree.
