<P> Follow <a href="mdp_opt.html">this link</a> for a detailed description of the options</a>.  </P>

<P> Below is a sample mdp file.
The ordering of the items is not important, but if you enter the same
thing twice, the <b>last</b> is used (grompp gives you a note when 
overriding values). Dashes and underscores on the 
left hand side are ignored.</P>

<P> The values of the options are reasonable values for a 1 nanosecond
MD run of a protein in a box of water. </P>
