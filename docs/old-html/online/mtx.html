<title>mtx file format</title>
<H3>Description</H3>
Files with the mtx file extension contain a matrix.
The file format is identical to the former trj format.
Currently this file format is only used for Hessian matrices,
which are produced with <a href="../programs/gmx-mdrun.html">gmx mdrun</a> and read by
<a href="../programs/gmx-nmeig.html">gmx nmeig</a>.
