Notes on data compatibility
===========================

Avoid dependencies
------------------

The same C++ symbol can have different bindings in each extension module, so
don't rely on C++ typing through bindings. Need schema for PyCapsules.

Adding gmxapi compatible Python bindings should not require dependency on gmxapi
Python package. Compatibility through interfaces instead of inheritance.
