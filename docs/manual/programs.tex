\section{On-line and HTML manuals}

\index{html manual}
% TODO Check that these statements and default file locations are
% current when the help-writing module has stabilized
All the information in this chapter can also be found in HTML
format in your {\gromacs} data directory. The path depends on
where your files are installed, but the default location is
{\tt /usr/local/gromacs/share/gromacs/html/online.html}.
If you installed from Linux packages it can typically be found as
{\tt /usr/share/gromacs/html/online.html}.
You can also use the online manual from the {\gromacs} web site,
\url{http://manual.gromacs.org/current}.

In addition, we install standard UNIX man pages for all the programs. If
you have sourced the {\tt GMXRC} script in the {\gromacs} binary directory for
your host they should already be present in your {\tt MANPATH} environment variable, and you
should be able to type {\eg} {\tt man gmx-grompp}. You can also use
the {\tt -h} flag on the command line (e.g. {\tt gmx grompp -h}) to
see the same information, as well as {\tt gmx help grompp}.
The list of all programs are available from {\tt gmx help}.

\section{File types\swapindexquiet{file}{type}}
\label{sec:fileformats}
\tabref{form} lists the file types used by {\gromacs} along with
a short description, and you can find a more detail description for
each file in your HTML reference, or in our online version.

{\gromacs} files written in \normindex{XDR} format can be read on any
architecture with {\gromacs} version 1.6 or later if the configuration
script found the XDR libraries on your system. They should always be
present on UNIX since they are necessary for NFS support.
