% This file may be used without modification as a style (.sty) file.
%
% If you have Mittelbach's doc.sty, this file may be formatted with a
% command like:
%                latex here.sty
%
% If you have the Mittelbach/Duchier/Braams docstrip utility, you may
% produce a faster loading .sty file.  Rename this file to: here.doc
% Then run this file through *plain* TeX:
%                tex here.doc
% This should produce the file here.sty.
% If you do not have plain TeX on your system, you can trick LaTeX into
% doing the work as follows:
%                latex \def\fmtname{plain} \input here.doc
% Note that you may need to quote the arguments here to stop your
% operating system treating the \ characters incorrectly.
%
%                latex here.doc
% Will produce a typeset version of the documentation, as above.

% \maketitle
% \begin{abstract}
% {\tt here.sty} gives environments such as {\tt figure} and {\tt table}
% a {\tt [H]} option  which means `PUT IT HERE'. As opposed to the
% standard {\tt [h]} option which means `You may put it here if you
% wish'.
% \end{abstract}
%
% \begin{figure}[H]
% This figure will not float, even if this causes a bad page break.
% \caption{It may be captioned as usual.}
% \end{figure}
%
% Many people have problems with \LaTeX's floating environments. A
% common complaint is that all the environments appear at the end of the
% document (or chapter). Many users try to correct this behaviour by
% using the {\tt [h]} option. Incorect use of this option, in particular
% using just {\tt [h]} rather than a more liberal option such as {\tt
% [hp]} actually makes the problem worse!
%
% \LaTeX\ will only position a float (even one with the {\tt [h]}
% option) in a position which does not violate the rules for float
% placement set by the document style. These rules are determined by the
% following parameters:
%
% \begin{table}[H]
% \begin{tabular}{lp{220pt}}
%  |\c@topnumber|&    Number of floats allowed at the top of a
%                          column.\\
%  |\topfraction|&    Fraction of column that can be devoted to
%                          floats.\\
%  |\c@dbltopnumber|\\ \verb|\dbltopfraction|&  Same as above, but for
%                          double-column floats.\\
%  |\c@bottomnumber|\\ \verb|\bottomfraction|&  Same as above for
%                          bottom of page.\\
%  |\c@totalnumber|&  Number of floats allowed in a single column,\\
%                       &  including in-text floats.\\
%  |\textfraction|&   Minimum fraction of column that must contain
%                          text.\\
%  |\floatpagefraction|& Minimum fraction of page that must be taken
%                          up by a  float page.\\
%  |\dblfloatpagefraction|&As above, for double-column floats.
% \end{tabular}
% \caption{\LaTeX`s float placement parameters}
% \end{table}
%
% The default settings (in {\tt article.doc} for {\tt article} style)
% for these parameters make it difficult to set floats if the document
% has a lot of small floats. The result is that \LaTeX\ `holds them
% back' in the hope of finding a better place later. At the end of the
% document (or at a |\clearpage|) it gives up and outputs all the
% remaining floats.
%
% It may be seen from the above paragraph that the `correct' way to
% handle float problems is to write a style file modifying these
% parameters, however for many purposes, authors to not want a float at
% all, they just use the {\tt figure} or {\tt table} environments to get
% the correct spacing, and a counter that may be referenced. This style
% option provides an easy solution in this case. If the {\tt [H]} option
% is specified, the environment will not float even if it causes a bad
% page break, or breaks the rules specified in the above parameters. The
% main drawback is that if the [H] option is used in one figure, and the
% following figure uses the {\tt [t]} option, then the second figure may
% float in front of the first.
%
% Note that the {\tt [H]} should not be used in conjunction with the
% other options. {\tt [Htp]} is not allowed by this style. The {\tt h}
% option may still be used, so {\tt [htp]} is OK.

% First we make sure that this file is only loaded once.

\ifx\@Hxfloat\@Hundef\else\expandafter\endinput\fi
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% \begin{macro}{\@Hxfloat}
% Now we can save the original version of |\@xfloat|.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\let\@Hxfloat\@xfloat
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}{\@xfloat}
% The new version of |@xfloat| looks for a |[H]| argument.
% If it is present |\@HHfloat| is called, otherwise the original macro
% (renamed to |\@Hfloat|) is called.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\@xfloat#1[{\@ifnextchar{H}{\@HHfloat{#1}[}{\@Hxfloat{#1}[}}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}{\@HHfloat}
% First gobble the |[H]|. Note that {\tt H} should not be used in
% conjunction with the other placement options, nor as the value of the
% default placement, as set in |\fps@|{\it type}.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\@HHfloat#1[H]{%
%    \end{macrocode}
% Locally redefine the end of the environment.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\expandafter\let\csname end#1\endcsname\end@Hfloat
%    \end{macrocode}
% Add the vertical space, and define |\caption|. Also reset
% |\parindent| for compatibility with the standard {\tt [h]} option.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\vskip\intextsep\vbox\bgroup\def\@captype{#1}\parindent\z@
%    \end{macrocode}
% The final |\ignorespaces| is needed to gobble any spaces or newlines
% after the {\tt[H]} tokens.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\ignorespaces}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}{\end@Hfloat}
% Add the same vertical space as would be added by a float placed with
% {\tt[h]}.
