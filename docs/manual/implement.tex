\chapter{Some implementation details}
In this chapter we will present some implementation details. This is
far from complete, but we deemed it necessary to clarify some things
that would otherwise be hard to understand.

\section{Single Sum Virial in {\gromacs}}
\label{sec:virial}
The \normindex{virial} $\Xi$ can be written in full tensor form as:
\beq
\Xi~=~-\half~\sum_{i < j}^N~\rvij\otimes\Fvij
\eeq
where $\otimes$ denotes the {\em direct product} of two vectors.\footnote
{$({\bf u}\otimes{\bf v})^{\ab}~=~{\bf u}_{\al}{\bf v}_{\be}$} When this is 
computed in the inner loop of an MD program 9 multiplications and 9
additions are needed.\footnote{The calculation of 
Lennard-Jones and Coulomb forces is about 50 floating point operations.}

Here it is shown how it is possible to extract the virial calculation
from the inner loop~\cite{Bekker93b}.

\subsection{Virial}
In a system with periodic boundary conditions\index{periodic boundary 
conditions}, the
periodicity must be taken into account for the virial:
\beq
\Xi~=~-\half~\sum_{i < j}^{N}~\rnij\otimes\Fvij
\eeq
where $\rnij$ denotes the distance vector of the
{\em nearest image} of atom $i$ from atom $j$. In this definition we add
a {\em shift vector} $\delta_i$ to the position vector $\rvi$ 
of atom $i$. The difference vector $\rnij$ is thus equal to:
\beq
\rnij~=~\rvi+\delta_i-\rvj
\eeq
or in shorthand:
\beq
\rnij~=~\rni-\rvj
\eeq
In a triclinic system, there are 27 possible images of $i$; when a truncated 
octahedron is used, there are 15 possible images.

\subsection{Virial from non-bonded forces}
Here the derivation for the single sum virial in the {\em non-bonded force} 
routine is given. There are a couple of considerations that are special
to {\gromacs} that we take into account:
\begin{itemize}
\item When calculating short-range interactions, we apply the 
{\em minimum image convention} and only consider the closest 
image of each neighbor - and in particular we never allow interactions
between a particle and any of its periodic images. For all the 
equations below, this means $i \neq j$.
\item In general, either the $i$ or $j$ particle might be shifted to a neighbor
cell to get the closest interaction (shift $\delta_{ij}$). However, with minimum image
convention there can be at most 27 different shifts for particles in the central cell,
and for typical (very short-ranged) biomolecular interactions there are typically only a few
different shifts involved for each particle, not to mention that each interaction can
only be present for one shift. 
\item For the {\gromacs} nonbonded interactions
we use this to split the neighborlist of each $i$ particle into multiple 
separate lists, where each list has a constant shift $\delta_i$ for the $i$ partlcle. We
can represent this as a sum over shifts (for which we use index $s$), with the constraint that
each particle interaction can only contribute to one of the terms in this sum, and the
shift is no longer dependent on the $j$ particles. For any sum that does not contain
complex dependence on $s$, this means the sum trivially reduces to just the sum
over $i$ and/or $j$.
\item To simplify some of the sums, we replace sums over $j<i$ with double sums over
all particles (remember, $i \neq j$) and divide by 2.
\end{itemize}

Starting from the above definition of the virial, we then get

&~=~&-\qrt~\sum_{s}~\sum_{i=1}^{N}~\left( {\mathbf r}_i + \delta_{i,s} \right) \otimes ~\sum_{j=1}^N {\mathbf F}_{ij,s} - \qrt \sum_{j=1}^N {\mathbf r}_j \otimes \sum_{i=1}^{N} {\mathbf F}_{ji} \nonumber \\
&~=~&-\qrt~\sum_{s}~\sum_{i=1}^{N}~\left( {\mathbf r}_i + \delta_{i,s} \right) \otimes {\mathbf F}_{i,s} - \qrt \sum_{j=1}^N~{\mathbf r}_j \otimes {\mathbf F}_{j}  \nonumber \\
&~=~&-\qrt~\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N}~{\mathbf r}_i  \otimes {\mathbf F}_{i} + \sum_{j=1}^N~{\mathbf r}_j \otimes {\mathbf F}_{j} \right) - \qrt \sum_{s}~\sum_{i=1}^{N} \delta_{i,s} \otimes {\mathbf F}_{i,s}  \nonumber \\
&~=~&-\half \sum_{i=1}^{N}~{\mathbf r}_i \otimes {\mathbf F}_{i} -\qrt \sum_{s}~\sum_{i=1}^{N}~\delta_{i,s} \otimes {\mathbf F}_{i,s} \nonumber \\
&~=~&-\half \sum_{i=1}^{N}~{\mathbf r}_i \otimes {\mathbf F}_{i} -\qrt \sum_{s}~\delta_{s} \otimes {\mathbf F}_{s} \nonumber \\
&~=~&\Xi_0 + \Xi_1
\eea
In the second-last stage, we have used the property that each shift vector itself does not depend on the coordinates of particle $i$, so it is possible to sum
up all forces corresponding to each shift vector (in the nonbonded kernels), and then just use a sum over the different shift vectors outside the kernels.
We have also used
\bea
\Fvi&~=~&\sum_{j=1}^N~\Fvij					\\
\Fvj&~=~&\sum_{i=1}^N~\Fvji
\eea
which is the total force on $i$ with respect to $j$. Because we use Newton's Third Law:
\beq
\Fvij~=~-\Fvji
\eeq
we must, in the implementation, double the term containing the shift $\delta_i$. Similarly, in a few places we have summed the shift-dependent force
over all shifts to come up with the total force per interaction or particle.

This separates the total virial $\Xi$ into a component $\Xi_0$ that is a single sum over particles, and a second component $\Xi_1$ that describes the influence of
the particle shifts, and that is only a sum over the different shift vectors.

\subsection{The intra-molecular shift (mol-shift)}
For the bonded forces and SHAKE it is possible to make a {\em mol-shift}
list, in which the periodicity is stored. We simple have an array {\tt mshift}
in which for each atom an index in the {\tt shiftvec} array is stored.

The algorithm to generate such a list can be derived from graph theory,
considering each particle in a molecule as a bead in a graph, the bonds 
as edges.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1]	Represent the bonds and atoms as bidirectional graph
\item[2]	Make all atoms white
\item[3]	Make one of the white atoms black (atom $i$) and put it in the
		central box
\item[4]	Make all of the neighbors of $i$ that are currently 
		white, gray 
\item[5]	Pick one of the gray atoms (atom $j$), give it the
		correct periodicity with respect to any of 
		its black neighbors
		and make it black
\item[6]	Make all of the neighbors of $j$ that are currently 
		white, gray
\item[7]	If any gray atom remains, go to [5]
\item[8]	If any white atom remains, go to [3]
\end{enumerate}
Using this algorithm we can 
\begin{itemize}
\item	optimize the bonded force calculation as well as SHAKE 
\item	calculate the virial from the bonded forces
	in the single sum method again
\end{itemize}

Find a representation of the bonds as a bidirectional graph.

\subsection{Virial from Covalent Bonds}
Since the covalent bond force gives a contribution to the virial, we have:
\bea
b	&~=~&	\|\rnij\|					\\
V_b	&~=~&	\half k_b(b-b_0)^2				\\
\Fvi	&~=~&	-\nabla V_b					\\
	&~=~&	k_b(b-b_0)\frac{\rnij}{b}			\\
\Fvj	&~=~&	-\Fvi
\eea
The virial contribution from the bonds then is:
\bea
\Xi_b	&~=~&	-\half(\rni\otimes\Fvi~+~\rvj\otimes\Fvj)	\\
	&~=~&	-\half\rnij\otimes\Fvi
\eea

\subsection{Virial from SHAKE}
An important contribution to the virial comes from shake. Satisfying 
the constraints a force {\bf G} that is exerted on the particles ``shaken.'' If this
force does not come out of the algorithm (as in standard SHAKE) it can be
calculated afterward (when using {\em leap-frog}) by:
\bea
\Delta\rvi&~=~&\rvi(t+\Dt)-
[\rvi(t)+{\bf v}_i(t-\frac{\Dt}{2})\Dt+\frac{\Fvi}{m_i}\Dt^2]	\\
{\bf G}_i&~=~&\frac{m_i\Delta\rvi}{\Dt^2}
\eea
This does not help us in the general case. Only when no periodicity
is needed (like in rigid water) this can be used, otherwise
we must add the virial calculation in the inner loop of SHAKE.

When it {\em is} applicable the virial can be calculated in the single sum way:
\beq
\Xi~=~-\half\sum_i^{N_c}~\rvi\otimes\Fvi
\eeq
where $N_c$ is the number of constrained atoms.

%Another method is the Non-Iterative shake as proposed (and implemented)
%by Yoneya. In this algorithm the Lagrangian multipliers are solved in a 
%matrix equation, and given these multipliers it is easy to get the periodicity
%in the virial afterwards.

\section{Optimizations}
Here we describe some of the algorithmic optimizations used 
in {\gromacs}, apart from parallelism. 

\subsection{Inner Loops for Water}
\label{sec:waterloops}
{\gromacs} uses special inner loops to calculate non-bonded
interactions for water molecules with other atoms, and yet
another set of loops for interactions between pairs of
water molecules. There highly optimized loops for two types of water models.
For three site models similar to
SPC~\cite{Berendsen81}, {\ie}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item   There are three atoms in the molecule.
\item   The whole molecule is a single charge group.
\item   The first atom has Lennard-Jones (\secref{lj}) and 
        Coulomb (\secref{coul}) interactions.
\item   Atoms two and three have only Coulomb interactions, 
        and equal charges.
\end{enumerate}
These loops also works for the SPC/E~\cite{Berendsen87} and 
TIP3P~\cite{Jorgensen83} water models.
And for four site water models similar to TIP4P~\cite{Jorgensen83}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item   There are four atoms in the molecule.
\item   The whole molecule is a single charge group.
\item   The first atom has only Lennard-Jones (\secref{lj}) interactions.
\item   Atoms two and three have only Coulomb (\secref{coul}) interactions, 
        and equal charges.
\item   Atom four has only Coulomb interactions.
\end{enumerate}

The benefit of these implementations is that there are more floating-point
operations in a single loop, which implies that some compilers
can schedule the code better. However, it turns out that even
some of the most advanced compilers have problems with scheduling, 
implying that manual tweaking is necessary to get optimum 
\normindex{performance}.
This may include common-sub-expression elimination, or moving
code around.
