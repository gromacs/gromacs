# This directory provides a unified place for building all kinds of
# GROMACS documentation. This includes some "static" content (Doxygen
# code documentation, reference manual, install guide, old online HTML
# pages), and content generated from the gmx program for the various
# tools (man and HTML pages). It also provides the "webpage" target,
# that combines all of the above (except man pages in man format) into
# a form suitable for automated deployment to the GROMACS website. It
# also provides the INSTALL file for the tarball.
#
# The webpage is mostly built by Sphinx.  Variable values for Sphinx
# substitutions are configured by CMake (for things like version numbers),
# using gmx_configure_version_file().  This happens during build time instead
# of configure time, because 1) some of the version variables are only
# available during build time, and 2) we don't want to do all the Sphinx setup
# during configuration to save some time when not building the content.
# All the generated values get put into conf-vars.py (generated from
# conf-vars.py.cmakein), which in turn is included by the Sphinx configuration
# file conf.py.

# Even if we aren't going to make the full webpage, set up to put all
# the documentation output in the same place, for convenience
