# This directory provides a unified place for building all kinds of
# GROMACS documentation. This includes some "static" content (Doxygen
# code documentation, reference manual, install guide, old online HTML
# pages), and content generated from the gmx program for the various
# tools (man and HTML pages). It also provides the "webpage" target,
# that combines all of the above (except man pages in man format) into
# a form suitable for automated deployment to the GROMACS website.

# Even if we aren't going to make the full webpage, set up to put all
# the documentation output in the same place, for convenience
