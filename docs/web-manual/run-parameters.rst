Run parameters and Programs
===========================

Online documentation
--------------------

More documentation is
available online from the
`|Gromacs| web site <http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation>`__.

In addition, we install standard UNIX man pages for all the programs. If
you have sourced the ``GMXRC`` script in the |Gromacs| binary
directory for your host they should already be present in your
``MANPATH`` environment variable, and you should be able to
type *e.g.* ``man gmx-grompp``. You can also use the
``-h`` flag on the command line (e.g. 
:ref:`gmx grompp <gmx grompp>` ``-h``) to see the same information, as well as
``gmx help grompp``. The list of all programs are available from
:ref:`gmx help <gmx help>`.

File types
----------

Table 
lists the file types used by |Gromacs|
along with a short description, and you can find a more detail
description for each file in your HTML reference, or in our online
version.

|Gromacs| files written in :ref:`xdr` format can be read
on any architecture with |Gromacs| version 1.6 or later if the
configuration script found the XDR libraries on your system. They should
always be present on UNIX since they are necessary for NFS support.

Run Parameters
--------------

The descriptions of :ref:`mdp` parameters can be found at
under the link above both in your local |Gromacs| installation,
or in the `release web manual <http://manual.gromacs.org/current/mdp-options.html>`__.
