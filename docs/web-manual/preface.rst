This manual is not complete and has no pretension to be so due
to lack of time of the contributors -- our first priority is to improve
the software. It is worked on continuously,
which in some cases might mean the information is not entirely correct.

Comments on form and content are welcome, please send them to one of
the mailing lists (see `www.gromacs.org <http://www.gromacs.org>`__, or open an issue
at `redmine.gromacs.org <http://redmine.gromacs.org>`__. Corrections can also be made in the |Gromacs| git
source repository and uploaded to `gerrit.gromacs.org <http://gerrit.gromacs.org>`__.

We release an updated version of the manual whenever
we release a new version of the software, so in general 
it is a good idea to use a manual with the same major and
minor release number as your |Gromacs| installation. 

On-line Resources
-----------------

You can find more documentation and other material at our homepage
`www.gromacs.org <http://www.gromacs.org>`__. Among other things there
is an on-line reference, several GROMACS mailing lists with archives and
contributed topologies/force fields.
