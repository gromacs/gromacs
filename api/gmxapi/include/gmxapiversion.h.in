/*! \file
 * \brief Implement versioning API for C++ external GROMACS interface.
 *
 *  Defines a class Version in the gmxapi namespace providing static methods
 *  for use by API client code at compile time and run time.
 *
 *  External interface uses semantic versioning scheme in which the major version
 *  specifies the API compatibility level, and minor version indicates additional
 *  features that may or may not be ABI compatible. Feature availability may be
 *  implied by API level, but the library can be queried for availability of
 *  explicitly named features. This is essential to allow compatibility and
 *  flexibility during development.
 *
 *  \ingroup gmxapi
 *
 *  \internal
 *   The version numbers for gmxapi are encoded in the repository solely in the
 * `src/api/CMakeLists.txt` file. During CMake configuration, the
 * `src/api/cpp/include/gmxapi/version.h` file is created so that the built library can report this
 * version through the `gmxapi::Version` interface. Client code should include the installed `gmxapi/version.h`
 * header in order to embed the constants `gmxapi::c_majorVersion`, `gmxapi::c_minorVersion`, and
 * `gmxapi::c_patchVersion` so that compatibility checks can be performed at runtime. Additional
 * CMake `check` utilities will probably be necessary to allow GROMACS installations to be forward
 * compatible with client code developed against the GROMACS main branch.
 *
 * When a new software release is tagged, the next commit on the development branch should increment
 * the patch level to distinguish development builds from the tagged release. As incompatibilities
 * are introduced in feature branches, minor or major version number should be incremented as
 * appropriate. At this time, client code has no indication of whether the version presented in a
 * development build of gmxapi is an officially specified API revision or is subject to change.
 * Developers coding against development branches should keep this in mind. If this becomes
 * problematic, please offer your suggestions or propose a revision to the `gmxapi::Version` API.
