<title>edo file format</title>
<h3>Description</h3>
Files with the edo file extension are generated by
<a href="../programs/gmx-mdrun.html">gmx mdrun</a>
if Molecular Dynamics is performed with Essential Dynamics
constraints. Depending on the parameters set in the <a href="edi.html">
edi</a> file, edo files may contain projections of positions,
velocities and forces onto selected eigenvectors during the run as well
as RMSD values, or information about specific types of constraints.
Specific results can be extracted from the edo files with standard unix 
utilities like <tt>awk</tt>.
