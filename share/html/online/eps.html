<title>eps file format</title>
<H3>Description</H3>
The eps file format is not a special GROMACS format, but just a 
variant of the standard PostScript(tm). A sample eps file as
generated by the <a href="../programs/gmx-xpm2ps.html">gmx xpm2ps</a> program is
included below. It shows the secondary structure of a peptide as a function
of time.
