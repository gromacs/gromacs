<title>tpb file format</title>
<h3>Description</h3>
The tpb file extension stands for binary run input file. This file contains 
the starting structure of your simulation, The molecular topology and 
all the simulation data. Because this file is in binary format it 
cannot be read with a normal editor. To read a binary run input file type:
<PRE>
% <a href="../programs/gmx-dump.html">gmx dump</a> -s topol.tpb
</PRE>
or if you're not such a fast reader:
<PRE>
% gmxdump -s topol.tpb | more
</PRE>

<p>
You can also compare two tpb files using:
<pre>
% <a href="../programs/gmx-check.html">gmx check</a> -s1 top1 -s2 top2 | more
</pre>
