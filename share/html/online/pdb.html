<title>pdb file format</title>
<H3>Description</H3>

Files with the <a href="pdb.html">.pdb</a> extension are molecular
structure files in the protein databank file format.  The protein
databank file format describes the positions of atoms in a molecular
structure. Coordinates are read from the ATOM and HETATM records,
until the file ends or an ENDMDL record is encountered.
GROMACS programs can read and write a simlation box in the
CRYST1 entry. 
The pdb format can also be used as a trajectory format:
several structures, seperated by ENDMDL, can be read from 
or written to one file.

An pdb file should look like this
