<h3>Description</h3>
This is a simple ASCII format:<br>
<pre>
TITLE
x(i) (10f8.3)
box(m) (10f8.8)
</pre>

The number of atoms is <b>not</b> stored, neither is there any indication
of whether a box is present. The box is stored only for constant pressure
simulations. So, you simply have to remember this stuff.
