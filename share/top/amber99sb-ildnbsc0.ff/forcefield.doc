ParmBSC0: Perez et al., Biophys J. 2(11), 3817–3829, 2007

Added the new atomtpye CI plus the bonds, angles (which are the same as CT) and dihedrals for the ParmBSC0 dihedrals, based on work by Thomas Piggot, May 2011, for the AMBER99SB force field.

If you use these parameters please cite, in addition to the original publications of the force fields (AMBER99SB-ILDN and/or ParmBSC0), the following work:
