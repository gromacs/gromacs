Once installed, this directory contains CMakelist.txt,
Makefile.pkg and a small program that you could use as
a template when writing your own analysis software.

The CMakelist.txt can be used together with cmake to
build the template program:
$ source /path/to/GMXRC
$ cmake /path/to/template

The Makefile.pkg can be used if cmake is unavailble. It
makes use of pkg-config only to build the template program:
$ source /path/to/GMXRC
$ make -f Makefile.pkg

You will need to make sure that you use a sufficiently similar C++
compiler and C++ Standard Library as the one that was used for
compiling GROMACS, preferably the same one.

In particular, if the compiler used for GROMACS was capable of some
C++11 features then by default those will be required for compiling
the template. To make that work, you can either configure GROMACS with
$ cmake -DGMX_CXX11=off
or configure the template with the appropriate
$ cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-flag-for-your-compiler"
You can find out the necessary flags from your compiler's docs, or
by inspecting the src/buildinfo.h file in the GROMACS build tree.

If you encounter errors like
  undefined reference to symbol '__cxa_free_exception@@CXXABI_1.3'
then you need to hint to the linker to link to the C++ Standard
Library (and again, it should be sufficiently similar to the one used
when linking GROMACS). For example, configure the template with
$ cmake -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-lstdc++"

----------------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this in the distribution directory,
remember that CMakelist.txt.template will be renamed to
CMakelist.txt during the installation.
