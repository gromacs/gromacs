Once installed, this directory contains CMakelist.txt,
Makefile.pkg and a small program that you could use as
a template when writing your own analysis software.

The CMakelist.txt can be used together with cmake to
build the template program:
$ source /path/to/GMXRC
$ cmake /path/to/template
Alternatively, setting CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH will direct cmake
to find a particular GROMACS installation.

The Makefile.pkg can be used if cmake is unavailable. It
makes use of pkg-config only to build the template program:
$ source /path/to/GMXRC
$ make -f Makefile.pkg

You will need to make sure that you use a sufficiently similar C++
compiler and C++ Standard Library as the one that was used for
compiling GROMACS, preferably the same one. If you used any system
libraries (e.g. Boost, FFTW, BLAS, LAPACK) when installing GROMACS,
then you will need make them available to the template build system
also. The easiest way to do this is to have pkg-config installed on
your system, and to source GMXRC from the GROMACS installation before
you attempt to configure the template. A subset of Boost is supposed
to be installed with GROMACS, but currently the automatic machinery
does not detect that installation, so you may need to install Boost
(headers only) in order to use the GROMACS template program.

If the compiler used for GROMACS was capable of some C++11 features
then, by default, those will be required for compiling the
template. To make that work, you can either configure GROMACS with
$ cmake -DGMX_CXX11=off
or configure the template with the appropriate
$ cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-flag-for-your-compiler"
You can find out the necessary flags from your compiler's documentation,
or by inspecting the src/buildinfo.h file in the GROMACS build tree.

If you are reading this in the distribution directory,
remember that CMakelist.txt.template will be renamed to
CMakelist.txt during the installation.
