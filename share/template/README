Once installed, this directory contains CMakelist.txt,
Makefile.pkg and a small program that you could use as
a template when writing your own analysis software.

The CMakelist.txt can be used together with cmake to
build the template program:
$ source /path/to/GMXRC
$ cmake /path/to/template

The Makefile.pkg can be used if cmake is unavailble. It
makes use of pkg-config only to build the template program:
$ source /path/to/GMXRC
$ make -f Makefile.pkg

----------------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this in the distribution directory,
remember that CMakelist.txt.template will be renamed to
CMakelist.txt during the installation.
