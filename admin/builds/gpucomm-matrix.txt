# This matrix is intended to permit Jenkins on-demand testing
# of code hidden behind the GMX_USE_BUFFER_OPS feature flag
# during development. When the feature flag is removed, the
# normal test matrices will be adapted to cover this code path.
#
# Comment line(s) preceding each configuration document the main
# intent behind that configuration, so that we can correctly judge
# whether to preserve that during maintenance decisions.
#
# Both configurations currently target bs_nix1204, for better load
# balance with pre-submit matrix, which makes heavier use of
# bs_nix1310 agent.
