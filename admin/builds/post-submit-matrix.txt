# Test on ARM v7
# Test ARM_NEON SIMD
# NOTE: We use release-with-debug-info because in debug mode the SIMD module does not compile
gcc-4.8 simd=ARM_NEON release-with-debug-info

# Test the mdrun-only build
# TODO In combination with gmx from another build, arrange to run regressiontests
clang-3.7 double mpi no-openmp fftpack mdrun-only

# Test MPMD PME with thread-MPI
# TODO Add double to this configuration if/when Carsten stablizes essentialdynamics tests
gcc-5 npme=1 nranks=2 no-openmp fftpack simd=avx_128_fma release

# Test non-default GMX_PREFER_STATIC_LIBS behavior
# TODO enable this
# msvc-2015 double no-threadmpi no-prefer-static-libs release

# Test behaviour when dlopen is not present
# TODO enable this
# icc-16.0 no-dlopen no-threadmpi double mkl release

# Test SSE4.1 SIMD
# Test single-rank GPU
gcc-4.8 nranks=1 gpu cuda-7.5 simd=sse4.1

# Test MPMD PME with library MPI
clang-4 npme=1 nranks=2 mpi

# Test non-default use of mdrun -gpu_id
# Test SSE2 SIMD
gcc-4.8 gpu npme=1 nranks=2 gpu_id=2 cuda-7.5 simd=sse2 release

# TODO
# Re-enable Phi build
# Test without TNG support
# Test without hwloc support
# Test with NVML support
# Test statically linked hwloc support (if/when it can work well)
# Test 3D DD (2D is partially covered in regressiontests)
# Test own-fftw build (from local copy of the file)
# Test mdrun -tunepme (e.g. with relaxed tolerances, for now)
# Consider testing of other CMake option paths
# Consider adding our ARMv8 dev board as slaves to test ARM_NEON_ASIMD too.
