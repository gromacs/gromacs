# Comment line(s) preceding each configuration document the main
# intent behind that configuration, so that we can correctly judge
# whether to preserve that during maintenance decisions.
#
# Other configurations might coincidentally test such configurations
# (e.g. because they are the current default), but it is appropriate
# to intend to teach each feature (or a feature combination) exactly
# once, and for the intent to be reflected precisely in the
# configuration syntax, so that the configurations are stable even
# if the defaults change in future.
