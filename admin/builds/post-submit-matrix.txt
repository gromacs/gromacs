# Comment line(s) preceding each configuration document the main
# intent behind that configuration, so that we can correctly judge
# whether to preserve that during maintenance decisions.
#
# Other configurations might coincidentally test such configurations
# (e.g. because they are the current default), but it is appropriate
# to intend to teach each feature (or a feature combination) exactly
# once, and for the intent to be reflected precisely in the
# configuration syntax, so that the configurations are stable even
# if the defaults change in future.

# Test the mdrun-only build

# Re-enable Phi build
# Test without TNG support
# Test without hwloc support

# Test statically linked hwloc support (if/when it can work well)
# Test 3D DD (2D is partially covered in regressiontests)

# Test mdrun -tunepme (e.g. with relaxed tolerances, for now)
# Consider testing of other CMake option paths
# Consider adding our ARM dev boards as slaves to improve cross-platform portability testing.
