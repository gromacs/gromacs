# The phrase "at time of release" refers to either the initial
# GROMACS release from that branch, or the next expected release
# from that branch. (We will tend not to retroactively support
# newer infrastructure in CI, unless it's either easy or of
# high impact.)

# TODO
# Add OpenMP support to a clang build, e.g. on a CUDA slave
# Add OpenMP support to ASAN build (but libomp.so in clang-4 reports leaks, so might need a suitable build or suppression)
# Test hwloc support
# Test newest supported LTS Ubuntu
# Migrate ThreadSanitizer test off GPU build slave
# Explore adding openmp to ThreadSanitizer configuration, perhaps can avoid Redmine #1850 if done differently
# Update gpu testing specifiers per https://redmine.gromacs.org/issues/2161
