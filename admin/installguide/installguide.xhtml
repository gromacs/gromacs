Windows (native, Cygwin or MinGW), BlueGene, Cray and probably others.
Technically, it can be compiled on any platform with an ANSI C
compiler and supporting libraries, such as the GNU C library. It can
even compile on an iPhone!

  <div class="para" id="S1.SS2.p1">
    <p class="p">GROMACS requires an ANSI C compiler that complies with the C89
standard. For best performance, the GROMACS team strongly
recommends you get the most recent version of your preferred compiler
for your platform (e.g. GCC 4.7 or Intel 12.0 or newer on x86
hardware). There is a large amount of GROMACS code introduced in
version 4.6 that depends on effective compiler optimization to get
high performance - the old assembly-language routines have all
gone. For other platforms, use the vendor's compiler, and check for
specialized information below.</p>

hardware vendor's MPI installation. The most recent version of
either of this is likely to be the best. LAM/MPI

CMake. The previous build system that used <span style="" class="text typewriter">configure</span> from
the GNU autotools package has been removed permanently. CMake
permits the GROMACS team to support a very wide range of hardware,
compilers and build configurations while continuing to provide the
portability, robustness and performance for which GROMACS is known.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="para" id="S1.SS3.p2">
    <p class="p">GROMACS requires CMake version 2.8.0 or higher. Lower
versions will not work. You can check whether CMake is installed,
and what version it is, with <span style="" class="text typewriter">cmake --version</span>. If you need to
install CMake, then first check whether your platform's package
management system provides a suitable version, or visit
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/install.html" title="" class="ref url"><span style="" class="text typewriter">http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/install.html</span></a> for pre-compiled

    <p class="p">FFTW is likely to be available for your platform via its package
management system, but there can be compatibility and significant
performance issues associated with these packages. In particular,
GROMACS simulations are normally run in single floating-point
precision whereas the default FFTW package is normally in double
precision, and good compiler options to use for FFTW when linked to
GROMACS may not have been used. Accordingly, the GROMACS team
recommends either</p>

the precision (i.e. single or float vs double) to match what you will
later require for GROMACS. There is no need to compile with
threading or MPI support, but it does no harm. On x86 hardware,
compile <em class="emph">only</em> with <span style="" class="text typewriter">--enable-sse2</span> (regardless of
precision) even if your processors can take advantage of AVX
extensions to SSE. The way GROMACS uses Fourier transforms
cannot take advantage of this feature in FFTW because of memory
system performance limitations, it can degrade performance by around
20%, and there is no way for GROMACS to require the use of the
SSE2 at run time if AVX support has been compiled into FFTW.</p>

    <p class="p">This section will cover a general build of GROMACS with CMake,
but it is not an exhaustive discussion of how to use CMake. There
are many resources available on the web, which we suggest you search
for when you encounter problems not covered here. The material below
applies specifically to builds on Unix-like systems, including Linux,
Mac OS X, MinGW and Cygwin. For other platforms, see the specialist
instructions below.</p>

    <h3 class="title subsection-title">§ 2.1. Configuring with CMake</h3>
  <div class="para" id="S2.SS1.p1">
    <p class="p">CMake will run many tests on your system and do its best to work
out how to build GROMACS for you. If you are building GROMACS on
hardware that is identical to that where you will run <span style="" class="text typewriter">mdrun</span>,
then you can be sure that the defaults will be pretty good. Howver, if
you want to control aspects of the build, there's plenty of things you
can set, too.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="para" id="S2.SS1.p2">
    <p class="p">The best way to use CMake to configure GROMACS is to do an
“out-of-source” build, by making another directory from which you
will run CMake. This can be a subdirectory or not, it doesn't
matter. It also means you can never corrupt your source code by trying
to build it! So, the only required argument on the CMake command
line is the name of the directory containing the
<span style="" class="text typewriter">CMakeLists.txt</span> file of the code you want to build. For
example, download the source tarball and use
</p>
  <pre class="verbatim">
$ tar xfz gromacs-4.6-beta1.tgz
$ cd gromacs-4.6
$ mkdir build-cmake
$ cd build-cmake
$ cmake ..

    <p class="p">You will see <span style="" class="text typewriter">cmake</span> report the results of a large number of tests on
your system made by CMake and by GROMACS. These are written to
the CMake cache, kept in <span style="" class="text typewriter">CMakeCache.txt</span>. You can edit this
file by hand, but this is not recommended because it is easy to reach
an inconsistent state. You should not attempt to move or copy this
file to do another build, because the paths are hard-coded within it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="para" id="S2.SS1.p4">
    <p class="p">If there's a serious problem detected at this stage, then you will see
a fatal error and some suggestions for how to overcome it. If you're
not sure how to deal with that, please start by searching on the web
(most computer problems already have known solutions!) and then
consult the <span style="" class="text typewriter">gmx-users</span> mailing list. There are also
informational warnings that you might like to take on board or
not. Piping the output of <span style="" class="text typewriter">cmake</span> through <span style="" class="text typewriter">less</span> or
<span style="" class="text typewriter">tee</span> can be useful, too.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="para" id="S2.SS1.p5">
    <p class="p">CMake works in an iterative fashion, re-running each time a setting
is changed to try to make sure other things are consistent. Once
things seem consistent, the iterations stop. Once <span style="" class="text typewriter">cmake</span>
returns, you can see all the settings that were chosen and information
about them by using <code class="verbatim">ccmake ..</code>. Check out
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html" title="" class="ref url"><span style="" class="text typewriter">http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html</span></a> for general
advice on what you are seeing and how to navigate and change
things. The settings you might normally want to change are already
presented. If you make any changes, then <span style="" class="text typewriter">ccmake</span> will notice
that and require that you re-configure (using '<code class="verbatim">c</code>'), so that it
gets a chance to make changes that depend on yours and perform more
checking. This might require several configuration stages when you are
using <span style="" class="text typewriter">ccmake</span> - when you are using <span style="" class="text typewriter">cmake</span> the
iteration is done behind the scenes.</p>

  <div class="para" id="S2.SS1.p6">
    <p class="p">A key thing to consider here is the setting of
<span style="" class="text typewriter">GMX_INSTALL_PREFIX</span>. You will need to be able to write to this
directory in order to install GROMACS later, and if you change your
mind later, changing it in the cache triggers a full re-build,
unfortunately. So if you do not have super-user privileges on your
machine, then you will need to choose a sensible location within your
home directory for your GROMACS installation.</p>

it is expected that the <span style="" class="text typewriter">make</span> procedure will always complete

    <p class="p">You're not alone, this can be a complex task. If you encounter a
problem with installing GROMACS, then there are a number of locations
where you can find assistance. It is recommended that you follow these
steps to find the solution:</p>

    <p class="p">Post to the GROMACS users emailing list <span style="" class="text typewriter">gmx-users</span> for
assistance. Be sure to give a full description of what you have done
and why you think it didn't work. Give details about the system on
which you are installing. Copy and paste your command line and as
much of the output as you think might be relevant - certainly from
the first indication of a problem. Describe the machine and
operating system you are running on. People who might volunteer to
help you do not have time to ask you interactive detailed follow-up
questions, so you will get an answer faster if you provide as much
information as you think could possibly help.</p>
