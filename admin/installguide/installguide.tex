\section{Prerequisites}

\subsection{Platform}

\gromacs{} can be compiled for any distribution of Linux, Mac OS X,
Windows (native, Cygwin or MinGW), BlueGene, Cray and probably others.
Technically, it can be compiled on any platform with an ANSI C
compiler and supporting libraries, such as the GNU C library. It can
even compile on an iPhone! There is a detailed list of hardware,
platform and compilers upon which we do build and regression testing
later in this document.

\subsection{Compiler}

\gromacs{} requires an ANSI C compiler that complies with the C89
standard. For best performance, the \gromacs{} team strongly
recommends you get the most recent version of your preferred compiler
for your platform (e.g. GCC 4.7 or Intel 12.0 or newer on x86
hardware). There is a large amount of \gromacs{} code introduced in
version 4.6 that depends on effective compiler optimization to get
high performance - the old assembly-language routines have all
gone. For other platforms, use the vendor's compiler, and check for
specialized information below.

\subsubsection{Running in parallel}

\gromacs{} can run in parallel on multiple cores of a single
workstation using its built-in \threadmpi. No user action is required
in order to enable this.

If you wish to use the excellent new native GPU support in \gromacs,
\nvidia{}'s \cuda{}
\url{http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html} version
\cudaversion{} software development kit is required, and the latest
version is encouraged. \nvidia{} GPUs with at least \nvidia{} compute
capability 2.0 are required, e.g. Fermi or Kepler cards.

The GPU support from \gromacs{} version 4.5 using \openmm{}
\url{https://simtk.org/home/openmm} is still available, also requires
\cuda{} (version ??), and remains the only hardware-based acceleration
available for implicit solvent simulations in \gromacs{}.

If you wish to run in parallel on multiple machines across a network,
you will need to have
\begin{itemize}
\item an \mpi{} library installed that supports the \mpi{} 1.3
  standard, and
\item wrapper compilers that will compile code using that library.
\end{itemize}
The \gromacs{} team recommends \openmpi{}
\url{http://www.open-mpi.org/} version 1.4.1 (or higher), \mpich{}
\url{http://www.mpich.org/} version 1.4.1 (or higher), or your
hardware vendor's \mpi{} installation. The most recent version of
either of this is likely to be the best. \lammpi{}
\url{http://www.lam-mpi.org/} may work, but since it has been
deprecated for years, it is not supported.

In some cases, \openmp{} parallelism is an advantage for \gromacs{},
but support for this is generally built into your compiler and you
need to make no advance preparation for this.

\subsection{CMake}

From version 4.6, \gromacs{} has moved to use the build system
\cmake{}. The previous build system that used \texttt{configure} from
the GNU autotools package has been removed permanently. \cmake{}
permits the \gromacs{} team to support a very wide range of hardware,
compilers and build configurations while continuing to provide the
portability, robustness and performance for which \gromacs{} is known.

\gromacs{} requires \cmake{} version \cmakeversion{} or higher. Lower
versions will not work. You can check whether \cmake{} is installed,
and what version it is, with \texttt{cmake --version}. If you need to
install \cmake{}, then first check whether your platform's package
management system provides a suitable version, or visit
\url{http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/install.html} for pre-compiled
binaries, source code and installation instructions. The \gromacs{}
team recommends you install the most recent version of \cmake{} you
can.

\subsection{Fast Fourier Transform library}

Many simulations in \gromacs{} make extensive use of Fourier transforms,
and a software library to perform these is always required. We
recommend \fftw{} \url{http://www.fftw.org/} (version 3 or higher
only) or Intel's \mkl{}
\url{http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl}.

\subsubsection{\fftw{}}

\fftw{} is likely to be available for your platform via its package
management system, but there can be compatibility and significant
performance issues associated with these packages. In particular,
\gromacs{} simulations are normally run in single floating-point
precision whereas the default \fftw{} package is normally in double
precision, and good compiler options to use for \fftw{} when linked to
\gromacs{} may not have been used. Accordingly, the \gromacs{} team
recommends either
\begin{itemize}
\item that you permit the \gromacs{} installation to download and
  build \fftw{} \fftwversion{} from source automatically
  for you, or
\item that you build \fftw{} from the source code.
\end{itemize}

If you build \fftw{} from source yourself, get the most recent version
and follow its installation guide
(e.g. \url{http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Installation-and-Customization.html}). Choose
the precision (i.e. single or float vs double) to match what you will
later require for \gromacs{}. There is no need to compile with
threading or \mpi{} support, but it does no harm. On x86 hardware,
compile \emph{only} with \texttt{--enable-sse2} (regardless of
precision) even if your processors can take advantage of \avx{}
extensions to \sse{}. The way \gromacs{} uses Fourier transforms
cannot take advantage of this feature in \fftw{} because of memory
system performance limitations, it can degrade performance by around
20\%, and there is no way for \gromacs{} to require the use of the
\ssetwo{} at run time if \avx{} support has been compiled into \fftw{}.

\subsubsection{\mkl{}}

Using \mkl{} requires a set of linker flags that \gromacs{} is not
able to detect for you, so setting up optimal linking is tricky at the
moment. Need better documentation later.

\subsection{Optional build components}

\begin{itemize}
\item A hardware-optimized \blas{} or \lapack{} library is useful for
  some of the \gromacs{} utilities, but is not needed for running
  simulations.
\item The built-in \gromacs{} trajectory viewer \texttt{ngmx} requires
  X11 and Motif/Lesstif libraries and header files. Generally, the
  \gromacs{} team recommends you use third-party software for
  visualization, such as \vmd{}
  \url{http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/} or \pymol{}
  \url{http://www.pymol.org/}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Doing a build of \gromacs}

This section will cover a general build of \gromacs{} with \cmake{},
but it is not an exhaustive discussion of how to use \cmake{}. There
are many resources available on the web, which we suggest you search
for when you encounter problems not covered here. The material below
applies specifically to builds on Unix-like systems, including Linux,
Mac OS X, MinGW and Cygwin. For other platforms, see the specialist
instructions below.

\subsection{Configuring with \cmake{}}

\cmake{} will run many tests on your system and do its best to work
out how to build \gromacs{} for you. If you are building \gromacs{} on
hardware that is identical to that where you will run \texttt{mdrun},
then you can be sure that the defaults will be pretty good. Howver, if
you want to control aspects of the build, there's plenty of things you
can set, too.

The best way to use \cmake{} to configure \gromacs{} is to do an
``out-of-source'' build, by making another directory from which you
will run \cmake{}. This can be a subdirectory or not, it doesn't
matter. It also means you can never corrupt your source code by trying
to build it! So, the only required argument on the \cmake{} command
line is the name of the directory containing the
\texttt{CMakeLists.txt} file of the code you want to build. For
example, download the source tarball and use
% TODO: keep up to date as we approach real releases!
\begin{verbatim}
$ tar xfz gromacs-4.6-beta1.tgz
$ cd gromacs-4.6
$ mkdir build-cmake
$ cd build-cmake
$ cmake ..
\end{verbatim}

You will see \texttt{cmake} report the results of a large number of tests on
your system made by \cmake{} and by \gromacs{}. These are written to
the \cmake{} cache, kept in \texttt{CMakeCache.txt}. You can edit this
file by hand, but this is not recommended because it is easy to reach
an inconsistent state. You should not attempt to move or copy this
file to do another build, because the paths are hard-coded within it.

If there's a serious problem detected at this stage, then you will see
a fatal error and some suggestions for how to overcome it. If you're
not sure how to deal with that, please start by searching on the web
(most computer problems already have known solutions!) and then
consult the \texttt{gmx-users} mailing list. There are also
informational warnings that you might like to take on board or
not. Piping the output of \texttt{cmake} through \texttt{less} or
\texttt{tee} can be useful, too.

\cmake{} works in an iterative fashion, re-running each time a setting
is changed to try to make sure other things are consistent. Once
things seem consistent, the iterations stop. Once \texttt{cmake}
returns, you can see all the settings that were chosen and information
about them by using \verb+ccmake ..+. Check out
\url{http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html} for general
advice on what you are seeing and how to navigate and change
things. The settings you might normally want to change are already
presented. If you make any changes, then \texttt{ccmake} will notice
that and require that you re-configure (using '\verb+c+'), so that it
gets a chance to make changes that depend on yours and perform more
checking. This might require several configuration stages when you are
using \texttt{ccmake} - when you are using \texttt{cmake} the
iteration is done behind the scenes.

A key thing to consider here is the setting of
\texttt{GMX\_INSTALL\_PREFIX}. You will need to be able to write to this
directory in order to install \gromacs{} later, and if you change your
mind later, changing it in the cache triggers a full re-build,
unfortunately. So if you do not have super-user privileges on your
machine, then you will need to choose a sensible location within your
home directory for your \gromacs{} installation.

When \texttt{cmake} or \texttt{ccmake} have completed iterating, the
cache is stable and a build tree can be generated, with '\verb+g+' in
\texttt{ccmake} or automatically with \texttt{cmake}.

\subsection{Building \gromacs{}}

Once you have a stable cache, you can build \gromacs{}. If you're not
sure the cache is stable, you can re-run \verb+cmake ..+ or
\verb+ccmake ..+' to see. Then you can run \texttt{make} to start the
compilation. Before actual compilation starts, \texttt{make} checks that the
cache is stable, so if it isn't you will see \cmake{} run again.

So long as any changes you've made to the configuration are sensible,
it is expected that the \texttt{make} procedure will always complete
successfully. The tests \gromacs{} makes on the settings you choose
are pretty extensive, but there are probably a few cases we haven't
thought of yet. Search the web first for solutions to problems,
but if you need help, ask on \texttt{gmx-users}, being sure to provide
as much information as possible about what you did, the system you are
building on, and what went wrong.

If you have a multi-core or multi-CPU machine with \texttt{N}
processors, then using
\begin{verbatim}
$ make -j N
\end{verbatim}
will generally speed things up by about a factor of \texttt{N}.

\subsection{Installing \gromacs{}}

Finally, \texttt{make install} will install \gromacs{} in the
directory given in \texttt{GMX\_INSTALL\_PREFIX}. If this is an system
directory, then you will need permission to write there, and you
should use super-user privileges only for \texttt{make install} and
not the whole procedure.

\subsection{Getting access to \gromacs{} after installation}

\gromacs{} installs the script \texttt{GMXRC} in the \texttt{bin}
subdirectory of the installation directory
(e.g. \texttt{/usr/local/gromacs/bin/GMXRC}), which you should source
from your shell:
\begin{verbatim}
$ source your-installation-prefix-here/bin/GMXRC
\end{verbatim}

It will detect what kind of shell you are running and
set up your environment for using \gromacs{}. You may wish to arrange
for your login scripts to do this automatically; please search the web
for instructions on how to do this for your shell.

\subsection{Testing \gromacs{}}
TODO install and use regression set

\subsection{Having difficulty?}

You're not alone, this can be a complex task. If you encounter a
problem with installing GROMACS, then there are a number of locations
where you can find assistance. It is recommended that you follow these
steps to find the solution:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Read the installation instructions again, taking note that you
  have followed each and every step correctly.
\item Search the \gromacs{} website and users emailing list for information on the error.
\item Search the internet using a search engine such as Google.
\item Post to the \gromacs{} users emailing list \texttt{gmx-users} for
  assistance. Be sure to give a full description of what you have done
  and why you think it didn't work. Give details about the system on
  which you are installing. Copy and paste your command line and as
  much of the output as you think might be relevant - certainly from
  the first indication of a problem. Describe the machine and
  operating system you are running on. People who might volunteer to
  help you do not have time to ask you interactive detailed follow-up
  questions, so you will get an answer faster if you provide as much
  information as you think could possibly help.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Advanced configuration}

TODO...
\begin{itemize}
\item manual compiler and linker flags
\item use of -D on the cmake command line (but avoid on ccmake command
line)
\item scripting \cmake{} once you are comfortable with things
\item use of shared vs static libraries
\item links to discussion of how to take advantage at configuration
  time of various forms of parallelism, acceleration and optimization,
  and when you'd want to... Berk? Szilard?
\end{itemize}

\section{Tested platforms}

While it is our best belief that \gromacs{} will build and run pretty
much everywhere, it's important that we tell you where we really know
it works because we've tested it. Every commit in our \texttt{git}
source code repository is test on ... We test irregularly on...

Contributions to this section are welcome.

Later we might set up the ability for users to contribute test results
to Jenkins.

\section{Other issues}

The \gromacs{} utility programs often write data files in formats
suitable for the \grace{} plotting tool, but it is straightforward to
use these files in other plotting programs, too.
