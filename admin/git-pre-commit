# This script is intended as a pre-commit hook that optionally runs all
# changes through some formatting check.  Currently, it runs uncrustify and
# checks copyright headers.
#
# It needs to be copied as .git/hooks/pre-commit and configured with
#   git config hooks.uncrustifypath /path/to/uncrustify
#   git config hooks.uncrustifymode check
#   git config hooks.copyrightmode update
#
# To disable the hook temporarily for a commit, set NO_FORMAT_CHECK environment
# variable.  For example,
#   NO_FORMAT_CHECK=1 git commit -a
# You can also run git commit --no-verify, but that also disables other hooks.
#
# See docs/dev-manual/code-formatting.rst for more details.
