# Test goal: Continuous integration testing for gmxapi clients development branch.
# (Note: does not yet distinguish branches or cross-check for forward/backward compatibility.)
# Test intents:
#   OS: Ubuntu oldest supported
#   GPU: unspecified
#   GROMACS: main
#   GROMACS MPI: thread-MPI
#   gmxapi: as per GROMACS main
#   client code:
#    * sample_restraint as bundled with GROMACS main
#    * TAF extension example as bundled with GROMACS main
#   Scope: build, install, test
# Test implementation choices (free to change as needed):
#   GROMACS branch: merge request target branch
#   gmxapi Python package: according to merge request target branch
#   sample code: according to merge request target branch
#   compiler: clang-14
