# This script is used by Gerrit to build the documentation in the
# Documentation_* jobs.  The main purpose of this script is to isolate Jenkins
# from the details of building the documentation, as the build system may still
# evolve.  All code here is tightly tied to the build system, and the interface
# to Jenkins tries to be as static as possible to avoid the need to rebase
# changes because of job configuration changes.
#
# Interface from Jenkins to this script is:
#  * the location of this script file,
#  * the first argument is the build type ("gerrit" or "nightly"),
#  * any additional arguments should be of form -Dxxx=yyy and are passed
#    to CMake to specify details related to Jenkins configuration, such as the
#    locations of the needed executables (e.g., DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE).
#
# Communication back to Jenkins is through
#  * return value of this script (non-zero marks the build failed).
#  * stdout (any instance of "FAILED" marks the build unstable),
#  * HTML documentation produced at build/docs/html/, and
#  * log files under build/docs/logs/:
#     - all .log files from this directory are published as Jenkins artifacts
#     - all .log files under doxygen/ subdir are scanned for Doxygen warnings
#     - all .log files under sphinx/ subdir are scanned for Sphinx warnings
