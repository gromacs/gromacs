The GROMACS developers generally suggest you install GROMACS for
production scientific use only from a tarball from an official
source-code release.

However, if you have a special need and wish to build and/or install a
version from a git repository, please see
docs/install-guide/index.rst in this repository, or (if applicable)
the latest master branch documentation found via
http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/.

Note for GROMACS developers
---------------------------
This file is excluded from the GROMACS source packages made with CPack,
and not included into binary packages made with CPack. Source packages
do include an INSTALL file containing the installation instructions, which
has been compiled into plain text by Sphinx from docs/install-guide.
