.SH DESCRIPTION
\&The gromacs preprocessor
\&reads a molecular topology file, checks the validity of the
\&file, expands the topology from a molecular description to an atomic
\&description. The topology file contains information about
\&molecule types and the number of molecules, the preprocessor
\&copies each molecule as needed. 
\&There is no limitation on the number of molecule types. 
\&Bonds and bond\-angles can be converted into constraints, separately
\&for hydrogens and heavy atoms.
\&Then a coordinate file is read and velocities can be generated
\&from a Maxwellian distribution if requested.
\&\fB grompp\fR also reads parameters for the \fB mdrun\fR 
\&(eg. number of MD steps, time step, cut\-off), and others such as
\&NEMD parameters, which are corrected so that the net acceleration
\&is zero.
\&Eventually a binary file is produced that can serve as the sole input
\&file for the MD program.


\&\fB grompp\fR uses the atom names from the topology file. The atom names
\&in the coordinate file (option \fB \-c\fR) are only read to generate
\&warnings when they do not match the atom names in the topology.
\&Note that the atom names are irrelevant for the simulation as
\&only the atom types are used for generating interaction parameters.


\&\fB grompp\fR uses a built\-in preprocessor to resolve includes, macros, 
\&etc. The preprocessor supports the following keywords:


\&ifdef VARIABLE

\&ifndef VARIABLE

\&else

\&endif

\&define VARIABLE

\&undef VARIABLE
include "filename"

\&include filename


\&The functioning of these statements in your topology may be modulated by
\&using the following two flags in your \fB .mdp\fR file:


\&\fB define = \-DVARIABLE1 \-DVARIABLE2

\&include = \-I/home/john/doe\fR

\&For further information a C\-programming textbook may help you out.
\&Specifying the \fB \-pp\fR flag will get the pre\-processed
\&topology file written out so that you can verify its contents.


\&When using position restraints a file with restraint coordinates
\&can be supplied with \fB \-r\fR, otherwise restraining will be done
\&with respect to the conformation from the \fB \-c\fR option.
\&For free energy calculation the the coordinates for the B topology
\&can be supplied with \fB \-rb\fR, otherwise they will be equal to
\&those of the A topology.


\&Starting coordinates can be read from trajectory with \fB \-t\fR.
\&The last frame with coordinates and velocities will be read,
\&unless the \fB \-time\fR option is used. Only if this information
\&is absent will the coordinates in the \fB \-c\fR file be used.
\&Note that these velocities will not be used when \fB gen_vel = yes\fR
\&in your \fB .mdp\fR file. An energy file can be supplied with
\&\fB \-e\fR to read Nose\-Hoover and/or Parrinello\-Rahman coupling
\&variables.


\&\fB grompp\fR can be used to restart simulations (preserving
\&continuity) by supplying just a checkpoint file with \fB \-t\fR.
\&However, for simply changing the number of run steps to extend
\&a run, using \fB tpbconv\fR is more convenient than \fB grompp\fR.
\&You then supply the old checkpoint file directly to \fB mdrun\fR
\&with \fB \-cpi\fR. If you wish to change the ensemble or things
\&like output frequency, then supplying the checkpoint file to
\&\fB grompp\fR with \fB \-t\fR along with a new \fB .mdp\fR file
\&with \fB \-f\fR is the recommended procedure.


\&By default, all bonded interactions which have constant energy due to
\&virtual site constructions will be removed. If this constant energy is
\&not zero, this will result in a shift in the total energy. All bonded
\&interactions can be kept by turning off \fB \-rmvsbds\fR. Additionally,
\&all constraints for distances which will be constant anyway because
\&of virtual site constructions will be removed. If any constraints remain
\&which involve virtual sites, a fatal error will result.

To verify your run input file, please take note of all warnings
\&on the screen, and correct where necessary. Do also look at the contents
\&of the \fB mdout.mdp\fR file; this contains comment lines, as well as
\&the input that \fB grompp\fR has read. If in doubt, you can start \fB grompp\fR
\&with the \fB \-debug\fR option which will give you more information
\&in a file called \fB grompp.log\fR (along with real debug info). You
\&can see the contents of the run input file with the \fB gmxdump\fR
\&program. \fB gmxcheck\fR can be used to compare the contents of two
\&run input files.

The \fB \-maxwarn\fR option can be used to override warnings printed
\&by \fB grompp\fR that otherwise halt output. In some cases, warnings are
\&harmless, but usually they are not. The user is advised to carefully
\&interpret the output messages before attempting to bypass them with
\&this option.
