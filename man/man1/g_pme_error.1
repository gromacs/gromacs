g_pme_error - estimates the error of using PME with a given input file

.SH DESCRIPTION
\&\fB g_pme_error\fR estimates the error of the electrostatic forces
\&if using the sPME algorithm. The flag \fB \-tune\fR will determine
\&the splitting parameter such that the error is equally
\&distributed over the real and reciprocal space part.
\&The part of the error that stems from self interaction of the particles is computationally demanding. However, a good a approximation is to
\&just use a fraction of the particles for this term which can be
\&indicated by the flag \fB \-self\fR.
