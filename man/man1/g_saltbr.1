.SH DESCRIPTION
\&g_saltbr plots the distance between all combination of charged groups
\&as a function of time. The groups are combined in different ways.
\&A minimum distance can be given, (eg. the cut\-off), then groups
\&that are never closer than that distance will not be plotted.

\&Output will be in a number of fixed filenames, min\-min.xvg, plus\-min.xvg
\&and plus\-plus.xvg, or files for every individual ion\-pair if the \fB \-sep\fR
\&option is selected. In this case files are named as \fB sb\-ResnameResnr\-Atomnr\fR.
\&There may be many such files.
