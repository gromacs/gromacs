.SH DESCRIPTION
\&g_dist can calculate the distance between the centers of mass of two
\&groups of atoms as a function of time. The total distance and its
\&x, y and z components are plotted.


\&Or when \fB \-dist\fR is set, print all the atoms in group 2 that are
\&closer than a certain distance to the center of mass of group 1.


\&With options \fB \-lt\fR and \fB \-dist\fR the number of contacts
\&of all atoms in group 2 that are closer than a certain distance
\&to the center of mass of group 1 are plotted as a function of the time
\&that the contact was continously present.


\&Other programs that calculate distances are \fB g_mindist\fR
\&and \fB g_bond\fR.
