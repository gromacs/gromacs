.SH DESCRIPTION
\&Genbox can do one of 3 things:


\&1) Generate a box of solvent. Specify \-cs and \-box. Or specify \-cs and
\&\-cp with a structure file with a box, but without atoms.


\&2) Solvate a solute configuration, eg. a protein, in a bath of solvent 
\&molecules. Specify \fB \-cp\fR (solute) and \fB \-cs\fR (solvent). 
\&The box specified in the solute coordinate file (\fB \-cp\fR) is used,
\&unless \fB \-box\fR is set.
\&If you want the solute to be centered in the box,
\&the program \fB editconf\fR has sophisticated options
\&to change the box dimensions and center the solute.
\&Solvent molecules are removed from the box where the 
\&distance between any atom of the solute molecule(s) and any atom of 
\&the solvent molecule is less than the sum of the VanderWaals radii of 
\&both atoms. A database (\fB vdwradii.dat\fR) of VanderWaals radii is 
\&read by the program, atoms not in the database are 
\&assigned a default distance \fB \-vdwd\fR.
\&Note that this option will also influence the distances between
\&solvent molecules if they contain atoms that are not in the database.
\&


\&3) Insert a number (\fB \-nmol\fR) of extra molecules (\fB \-ci\fR) 
\&at random positions.
\&The program iterates until \fB nmol\fR molecules
\&have been inserted in the box. To test whether an insertion is 
\&successful the same VanderWaals criterium is used as for removal of 
\&solvent molecules. When no appropriately 
\&sized holes (holes that can hold an extra molecule) are available the 
\&program tries for \fB \-nmol\fR * \fB \-try\fR times before giving up. 
\&Increase \-try if you have several small holes to fill.


\&The default solvent is Simple Point Charge water (SPC), with coordinates 
\&from \fB $GMXLIB/spc216.gro\fR. These coordinates can also be used
\&for other 3\-site water models, since a short equibilibration will remove
\&the small differences between the models.
\&Other solvents are also supported, as well as mixed solvents. The
\&only restriction to solvent types is that a solvent molecule consists
\&of exactly one residue. The residue information in the coordinate
\&files is used, and should therefore be more or less consistent.
\&In practice this means that two subsequent solvent molecules in the 
\&solvent coordinate file should have different residue number.
\&The box of solute is built by stacking the coordinates read from
\&the coordinate file. This means that these coordinates should be 
\&equlibrated in periodic boundary conditions to ensure a good
\&alignment of molecules on the stacking interfaces.
\&The \fB \-maxsol\fR option simply adds only the first \fB \-maxsol\fR
\&solvent molecules and leaves out the rest would have fit into the box.
\&


\&The program can optionally rotate the solute molecule to align the
\&longest molecule axis along a box edge. This way the amount of solvent
\&molecules necessary is reduced.
\&It should be kept in mind that this only works for
\&short simulations, as eg. an alpha\-helical peptide in solution can 
\&rotate over 90 degrees, within 500 ps. In general it is therefore 
\&better to make a more or less cubic box.


\&Setting \-shell larger than zero will place a layer of water of
\&the specified thickness (nm) around the solute. Hint: it is a good
\&idea to put the protein in the center of a box first (using editconf).
\&


\&Finally, genbox will optionally remove lines from your topology file in 
\&which a number of solvent molecules is already added, and adds a 
\&line with the total number of solvent molecules in your coordinate file.
