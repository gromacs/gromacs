.SH DESCRIPTION
\&This program reads a \fB .pdb\fR (or \fB .gro\fR) file, reads
\&some database files, adds hydrogens to the molecules and generates
\&coordinates in GROMACS (GROMOS), or optionally \fB .pdb\fR, format
\&and a topology in GROMACS format.
\&These files can subsequently be processed to generate a run input file.
\&


\&\fB pdb2gmx\fR will search for force fields by looking for
\&a \fB forcefield.itp\fR file in subdirectories \fB forcefield.ff\fR
\&of the current working directory and of the Gromacs library directory
\&as inferred from the path of the binary or the \fB GMXLIB\fR environment
\&variable.
\&By default the forcefield selection is interactive,
\&but you can use the \fB \-ff\fR option to specify one of the short names
\&in the list on the command line instead. In that case \fB pdb2gmx\fR just looks
\&for the corresponding \fB forcefield.ff\fR directory.
\&


\&After choosing a force field, all files will be read only from
\&the corresponding force field directory.
\&If you want to modify or add a residue types, you can copy the force
\&field directory from the Gromacs library directory to your current
\&working directory. If you want to add new protein residue types,
\&you will need to modify \fB residuetypes.dat\fR in the library directory
\&or copy the whole library directory to a local directory and set
\&the environment variable \fB GMXLIB\fR to the name of that directory.
\&Check Chapter 5 of the manual for more information about file formats.
\&


\&Note that a \fB .pdb\fR file is nothing more than a file format, and it
\&need not necessarily contain a protein structure. Every kind of
\&molecule for which there is support in the database can be converted.
\&If there is no support in the database, you can add it yourself.


\&The program has limited intelligence, it reads a number of database
\&files, that allow it to make special bonds (Cys\-Cys, Heme\-His, etc.),
\&if necessary this can be done manually. The program can prompt the
\&user to select which kind of LYS, ASP, GLU, CYS or HIS residue she
\&wants. For LYS the choice is between neutral (two protons on NZ) or
\&protonated (three protons, default), for ASP and GLU unprotonated
\&(default) or protonated, for HIS the proton can be either on ND1,
\&on NE2 or on both. By default these selections are done automatically.
\&For His, this is based on an optimal hydrogen bonding
\&conformation. Hydrogen bonds are defined based on a simple geometric
\&criterion, specified by the maximum hydrogen\-donor\-acceptor angle
\&and donor\-acceptor distance, which are set by \fB \-angle\fR and
\&\fB \-dist\fR respectively.


\&The separation of chains is not entirely trivial since the markup
\&in user\-generated PDB files frequently varies and sometimes it
\&is desirable to merge entries across a TER record, for instance
\&if you want a disulfide bridge or distance restraints between
\&two protein chains or if you have a HEME group bound to a protein.
\&In such cases multiple chains should be contained in a single
\&\fB moleculetype\fR definition.
\&To handle this, \fB pdb2gmx\fR has an option \fB \-chainsep\fR so you can
\&choose whether a new chain should start when we find a TER record,
\&when the chain id changes, combinations of either or both of these
\&or fully interactively.


\&\fB pdb2gmx\fR will also check the occupancy field of the \fB .pdb\fR file.
\&If any of the occupancies are not one, indicating that the atom is
\&not resolved well in the structure, a warning message is issued.
\&When a \fB .pdb\fR file does not originate from an X\-ray structure determination
\&all occupancy fields may be zero. Either way, it is up to the user
\&to verify the correctness of the input data (read the article!).


\&During processing the atoms will be reordered according to GROMACS
\&conventions. With \fB \-n\fR an index file can be generated that
\&contains one group reordered in the same way. This allows you to
\&convert a GROMOS trajectory and coordinate file to GROMOS. There is
\&one limitation: reordering is done after the hydrogens are stripped
\&from the input and before new hydrogens are added. This means that
\&you should not use \fB \-ignh\fR.


\&The \fB .gro\fR and \fB .g96\fR file formats do not support chain
\&identifiers. Therefore it is useful to enter a \fB .pdb\fR file name at
\&the \fB \-o\fR option when you want to convert a multi\-chain \fB .pdb\fR file.
\&


\&The option \fB \-vsite\fR removes hydrogen and fast improper dihedral
\&motions. Angular and out\-of\-plane motions can be removed by changing
\&hydrogens into virtual sites and fixing angles, which fixes their
\&position relative to neighboring atoms. Additionally, all atoms in the
\&aromatic rings of the standard amino acids (i.e. PHE, TRP, TYR and HIS)
\&can be converted into virtual sites, eliminating the fast improper dihedral
\&fluctuations in these rings. \fB Note\fR that in this case all other hydrogen
\&atoms are also converted to virtual sites. The mass of all atoms that are
\&converted into virtual sites, is added to the heavy atoms.


\&Also slowing down of dihedral motion can be done with \fB \-heavyh\fR
\&done by increasing the hydrogen\-mass by a factor of 4. This is also
\&done for water hydrogens to slow down the rotational motion of water.
\&The increase in mass of the hydrogens is subtracted from the bonded
\&(heavy) atom so that the total mass of the system remains the same.
