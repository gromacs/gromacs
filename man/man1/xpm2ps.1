.SH DESCRIPTION
\&\fB xpm2ps\fR makes a beautiful color plot of an XPixelMap file.
\&Labels and axis can be displayed, when they are supplied
\&in the correct matrix format.
\&Matrix data may be generated by programs such as \fB do_dssp\fR, \fB g_rms\fR or
\&\fB g_mdmat\fR.


\&Parameters are set in the \fB .m2p\fR file optionally supplied with
\&\fB \-di\fR. Reasonable defaults are provided. Settings for the \fI y\fR\-axis
\&default to those for the \fI x\fR\-axis. Font names have a defaulting hierarchy:
\&titlefont \- legendfont; titlefont \- (xfont \- yfont \- ytickfont)
\&\- xtickfont, e.g. setting titlefont sets all fonts, setting xfont
\&sets yfont, ytickfont and xtickfont.


\&When no \fB .m2p\fR file is supplied, many settings are taken from
\&command line options. The most important option is \fB \-size\fR,
\&which sets the size of the whole matrix in postscript units.
\&This option can be overridden with the \fB \-bx\fR and \fB \-by\fR
\&options (and the corresponding parameters in the \fB .m2p\fR file),
\&which set the size of a single matrix element.


\&With \fB \-f2\fR a second matrix file can be supplied. Both matrix
\&files will be read simultaneously and the upper left half of the
\&first one (\fB \-f\fR) is plotted together with the lower right
\&half of the second one (\fB \-f2\fR). The diagonal will contain
\&values from the matrix file selected with \fB \-diag\fR.
\&Plotting of the diagonal values can be suppressed altogether by
\&setting \fB \-diag\fR to \fB none\fR.
\&In this case, a new color map will be generated with
\&a red gradient for negative numbers and a blue for positive.
\&If the color coding and legend labels of both matrices are identical,
\&only one legend will be displayed, else two separate legends are
\&displayed.
\&With \fB \-combine\fR, an alternative operation can be selected
\&to combine the matrices. The output range is automatically set
\&to the actual range of the combined matrix. This can be overridden
\&with \fB \-cmin\fR and \fB \-cmax\fR.


\&\fB \-title\fR can be set to \fB none\fR to suppress the title, or to
\&\fB ylabel\fR to show the title in the Y\-label position (alongside
\&the \fI y\fR\-axis).


\&With the \fB \-rainbow\fR option, dull grayscale matrices can be turned
\&into attractive color pictures.


\&Merged or rainbowed matrices can be written to an XPixelMap file with
\&the \fB \-xpm\fR option.
