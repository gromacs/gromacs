.SH DESCRIPTION
\&g_hbond computes and analyzes hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds are
\&determined based on cutoffs for the angle Acceptor \- Donor \- Hydrogen
\&(zero is extended) and the distance Hydrogen \- Acceptor.
\&OH and NH groups are regarded as donors, O is an acceptor always,
\&N is an acceptor by default, but this can be switched using
\&\fB \-nitacc\fR. Dummy hydrogen atoms are assumed to be connected
\&to the first preceding non\-hydrogen atom.


\&You need to specify two groups for analysis, which must be either
\&identical or non\-overlapping. All hydrogen bonds between the two
\&groups are analyzed.


\&If you set \-shell, you will be asked for an additional index group
\&which should contain exactly one atom. In this case, only hydrogen
\&bonds between atoms within the shell distance from the one atom are
\&considered.

\&\fR

\&Note that the triplets need not be on separate lines.
\&Each atom triplet specifies a hydrogen bond to be analyzed,
\&note also that no check is made for the types of atoms.


\&\fB Output:\fR

\&\fB \-num\fR:  number of hydrogen bonds as a function of time.

\&\fB \-ac\fR:   average over all autocorrelations of the existence
\&functions (either 0 or 1) of all hydrogen bonds.

\&\fB \-dist\fR: distance distribution of all hydrogen bonds.

\&\fB \-ang\fR:  angle distribution of all hydrogen bonds.

\&\fB \-hx\fR:   the number of n\-n+i hydrogen bonds as a function of time
\&where n and n+i stand for residue numbers and i ranges from 0 to 6.
\&This includes the n\-n+3, n\-n+4 and n\-n+5 hydrogen bonds associated
\&with helices in proteins.

\&\fB \-hbn\fR:  all selected groups, donors, hydrogens and acceptors
\&for selected groups, all hydrogen bonded atoms from all groups and
\&all solvent atoms involved in insertion.

\&\fB \-hbm\fR:  existence matrix for all hydrogen bonds over all
\&frames, this also contains information on solvent insertion
\&into hydrogen bonds. Ordering is identical to that in \fB \-hbn\fR
\&index file.

\&\fB \-dan\fR: write out the number of donors and acceptors analyzed for
\&each timeframe. This is especially useful when using \fB \-shell\fR.

\&\fB \-nhbdist\fR: compute the number of HBonds per hydrogen in order to
\&compare results to Raman Spectroscopy.
\&


\&Note: options \fB \-ac\fR, \fB \-life\fR, \fB \-hbn\fR and \fB \-hbm\fR
\&require an amount of memory proportional to the total numbers of donors
\&times the total number of acceptors in the selected group(s).
