.SH DESCRIPTION
g_nmeig calculates the eigenvectors/values of a (Hessian) matrix,
which can be calculated with 
.B mdrun
.
The eigenvectors are written to a trajectory file (
.B -v
).
The structure is written first with t=0. The eigenvectors
are written as frames with the eigenvector number as timestamp.
The eigenvectors can be analyzed with 
.B g_anaeig
.
An ensemble of structures can be generated from the eigenvectors with

.B g_nmens
. When mass weighting is used, the generated eigenvectors
will be scaled back to plain cartesian coordinates before generating the
output - in this case they will no longer be exactly orthogonal in the
standard cartesian norm (But in the mass weighted norm they would be).
