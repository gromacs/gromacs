.SH DESCRIPTION
\&g_sdf calculates the spatial distribution function (SDF) of a set of atoms
\&within a coordinate system defined by three atoms. There is single body, 
\&two body and three body SDF implemented (select with option \-mode). 
\&In the single body case the local coordinate system is defined by using
\&a triple of atoms from one single molecule, for the two and three body case
\&the configurations are dynamically searched complexes of two or three
\&molecules (or residues) meeting certain distance consitions (see below).


\&The program needs a trajectory, a GROMACS run input file and an index 
\&file to work. 
\&You have to setup 4 groups in the index file before using g_sdf: 


\&The first three groups are used to define the SDF coordinate system.
\&The program will dynamically generate the atom triples according to 
\&the selected \-mode: 
\&In \-mode 1 the triples will be just the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... atoms from 
\&groups 1, 2 and 3. Hence the nth entries in groups 1, 2 and 3 must be from the
\&same residue. In \-mode 2 the triples will be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... atoms from
\&groups 1 and 2 (with the nth entries in groups 1 and 2 having the same res\-id).
\&For each pair from groups 1 and 2  group 3 is searched for an atom meeting the
\&distance conditions set with \-triangle and \-dtri relative to atoms 1 and 2. In
\&\-mode 3 for each atom in group 1 group 2 is searched for an atom meeting the
\&distance condition and if a pair is found group 3 is searched for an atom
\&meeting the further conditions. The triple will only be used if all three atoms
\&have different res\-id's.


\&The local coordinate system is always defined using the following scheme:
\&Atom 1 will be used as the point of origin for the SDF. 
\&Atom 1 and 2 will define the principle axis (Z) of the coordinate system.
\&The other two axis will be defined inplane (Y) and normal (X) to the plane through
\&Atoms 1, 2 and 3. 
\&The fourth group
\&contains the atoms for which the SDF will be evaluated.


\&For \-mode 2 and 3 you have to define the distance conditions for the 
\&2 resp. 3 molecule complexes to be searched for using \-triangle and \-dtri.


\&The SDF will be sampled in cartesian coordinates.
\&Use '\-grid x y z' to define the size of the SDF grid around the 
\&reference molecule. 
\&The Volume of the SDF grid will be V=x*y*z (nm3). 
\&Use \-bin to set the binwidth for grid.


\&The output will be a binary 3D\-grid file (gom_plt.dat) in the .plt format that can be be
\&read directly by gOpenMol. 
\&The option \-r will generate a .gro file with the reference molecule(s) transferred to
\&the SDF coordinate system. Load this file into gOpenMol and display the
\&SDF as a contour plot (see http://www.csc.fi/gopenmol/index.phtml for 
\&further documentation). 


\&For further information about SDF's have a look at: A. Vishnyakov, JPC A, 105,
\&2001, 1702 and the references cited within.
