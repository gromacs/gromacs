.SH DESCRIPTION
\&gmxcheck reads a trajectory (\fB .trj\fR, \fB .trr\fR or 
\&\fB .xtc\fR), an energy file (\fB .ene\fR or \fB .edr\fR)
\&or an index file (\fB .ndx\fR)
\&and prints out useful information about them.


\&Option \fB \-c\fR checks for presence of coordinates,
\&velocities and box in the file, for close contacts (smaller than
\&\fB \-vdwfac\fR and not bonded, i.e. not between \fB \-bonlo\fR
\&and \fB \-bonhi\fR, all relative to the sum of both Van der Waals
\&radii) and atoms outside the box (these may occur often and are
\&no problem). If velocities are present, an estimated temperature
\&will be calculated from them.


\&If an index file, is given its contents will be summarized.


\&If both a trajectory and a tpr file are given (with \fB \-s1\fR)
\&the program will check whether the bond lengths defined in the tpr
\&file are indeed correct in the trajectory. If not you may have
\&non\-matching files due to e.g. deshuffling or due to problems with
\&virtual sites. With these flags, gmxcheck provides a quick check for such problems.


\&The program can compare two run input (\fB .tpr\fR, \fB .tpb\fR or
\&\fB .tpa\fR) files
\&when both \fB \-s1\fR and \fB \-s2\fR are supplied.
\&Similarly a pair of trajectory files can be compared (using the \fB \-f2\fR
\&option), or a pair of energy files (using the \fB \-e2\fR option).


\&For free energy simulations the A and B state topology from one
\&run input file can be compared with options \fB \-s1\fR and \fB \-ab\fR.


\&In case the \fB \-m\fR flag is given a LaTeX file will be written
\&consisting of a rough outline for a methods section for a paper.
