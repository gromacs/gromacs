.SH DESCRIPTION
\&genion replaces solvent molecules by monoatomic ions at
\&the position of the first atoms with the most favorable electrostatic
\&potential or at random. The potential is calculated on all atoms, using
\&normal GROMACS particle based methods (in contrast to other methods
\&based on solving the Poisson\-Boltzmann equation).
\&The potential is recalculated after every ion insertion.
\&If specified in the run input file, a reaction field, shift function
\&or user function can be used. For the user function a table file
\&can be specified with the option \fB \-table\fR.
\&The group of solvent molecules should be continuous and all molecules
\&should have the same number of atoms.
\&The user should add the ion molecules to the topology file or use
\&the \fB \-p\fR option to automatically modify the topology.


\&The ion molecule type, residue and atom names in all force fields
\&are the capitalized element names without sign. Ions which can have
\&multiple charge states get the multiplicilty added, without sign,
\&for the uncommon states only.


\&With the option \fB \-pot\fR the potential can be written as B\-factors
\&in a pdb file (for visualisation using e.g. rasmol).
\&The unit of the potential is 1000 kJ/(mol e), the scaling be changed
\&with the \fB \-scale\fR option.


\&For larger ions, e.g. sulfate we recommended to use genbox.

.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.BI "\-[no]h"  "no    "
 Print help info and quit

.BI "\-[no]version"  "no    "
 Print version info and quit

.BI "\-nice"  " int" " 19" 
 Set the nicelevel

.BI "\-xvg"  " enum" " xmgrace" 
 xvg plot formatting: \fB xmgrace\fR, \fB xmgr\fR or \fB none\fR

.BI "\-np"  " int" " 0" 
 Number of positive ions

.BI "\-pname"  " string" " NA" 
 Name of the positive ion

.BI "\-pq"  " int" " 1" 
 Charge of the positive ion

.BI "\-nn"  " int" " 0" 
 Number of negative ions

.BI "\-nname"  " string" " CL" 
 Name of the negative ion

.BI "\-nq"  " int" " \-1" 
 Charge of the negative ion

.BI "\-rmin"  " real" " 0.6   " 
 Minimum distance between ions

.BI "\-[no]random"  "yes   "
 Use random placement of ions instead of based on potential. The rmin option should still work

.BI "\-seed"  " int" " 1993" 
 Seed for random number generator

.BI "\-scale"  " real" " 0.001 " 
 Scaling factor for the potential for \-pot

.BI "\-conc"  " real" " 0     " 
 Specify salt concentration (mol/liter). This will add sufficient ions to reach up to the specified concentration as computed from the volume of the cell in the input tpr file. Overrides the \-np and  nn options.

.BI "\-[no]neutral"  "no    "
 This option will add enough ions to neutralize the system. In combination with the concentration option a neutral system at a given salt concentration will be generated.

.SH KNOWN PROBLEMS
\- Calculation of the potential is not reliable, therefore the \fB \-random\fR option is now turned on by default.

\- If you specify a salt concentration existing ions are not taken into account. In effect you therefore specify the amount of salt to be added.
