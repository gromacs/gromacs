.SH DESCRIPTION
\&\fB make_edi\fR generates an essential dynamics (ED) sampling input file to be used with \fB mdrun\fR
\&based on eigenvectors of a covariance matrix (\fB g_covar\fR) or from a
\&normal modes anaysis (\fB g_nmeig\fR).
\&ED sampling can be used to manipulate the position along collective coordinates
\&(eigenvectors) of (biological) macromolecules during a simulation. Particularly,
\&it may be used to enhance the sampling efficiency of MD simulations by stimulating
\&the system to explore new regions along these collective coordinates. A number
\&of different algorithms are implemented to drive the system along the eigenvectors
\&(\fB \-linfix\fR, \fB \-linacc\fR, \fB \-radfix\fR, \fB \-radacc\fR, \fB \-radcon\fR),
\&to keep the position along a certain (set of) coordinate(s) fixed (\fB \-linfix\fR),
\&or to only monitor the projections of the positions onto
\&these coordinates (\fB \-mon\fR).

You will be prompted for one or more index groups that correspond to the eigenvectors,
\&reference structure, target positions, etc.


\&\fB \-mon\fR: monitor projections of the coordinates onto selected eigenvectors.


\&\fB \-linfix\fR: perform fixed\-step linear expansion along selected eigenvectors.


\&\fB \-linacc\fR: perform acceptance linear expansion along selected eigenvectors.
\&(steps in the desired directions will be accepted, others will be rejected).


\&\fB \-radfix\fR: perform fixed\-step radius expansion along selected eigenvectors.


\&\fB \-radacc\fR: perform acceptance radius expansion along selected eigenvectors.
\&(steps in the desired direction will be accepted, others will be rejected).
\&\fB Note:\fR by default the starting MD structure will be taken as origin of the first
\&expansion cycle for radius expansion. If \fB \-ori\fR is specified, you will be able
\&to read in a structure file that defines an external origin.


\&\fB \-radcon\fR: perform acceptance radius contraction along selected eigenvectors
\&towards a target structure specified with \fB \-tar\fR.


\&NOTE: each eigenvector can be selected only once. 


\&\fB \-outfrq\fR: frequency (in steps) of writing out projections etc. to \fB .edo\fR file


\&\fB \-slope\fR: minimal slope in acceptance radius expansion. A new expansion
\&cycle will be started if the spontaneous increase of the radius (in nm/step)
\&is less than the value specified.


\&\fB \-maxedsteps\fR: maximum number of steps per cycle in radius expansion
\&before a new cycle is started.


\&Note on the parallel implementation: since ED sampling is a 'global' thing
\&(collective coordinates etc.), at least on the 'protein' side, ED sampling
\&is not very parallel\-friendly from an implentation point of view. Because
\&parallel ED requires some extra communication, expect the performance to be
\&lower as in a free MD simulation, especially on a large number of nodes. 


\&All output of \fB mdrun\fR (specify with \fB \-eo\fR) is written to a .edo file. In the output
\&file, per OUTFRQ step the following information is present: 


\&\fB *\fR the step number

\&\fB *\fR the number of the ED dataset. (\fB Note\fR that you can impose multiple ED constraints in
\&a single simulation (on different molecules) if several \fB .edi\fR files were concatenated
\&first. The constraints are applied in the order they appear in the \fB .edi\fR file.) 

\&\fB *\fR RMSD (for atoms involved in fitting prior to calculating the ED constraints)

\&* projections of the positions onto selected eigenvectors

\&




\&FLOODING:


\&with \fB \-flood\fR, you can specify which eigenvectors are used to compute a flooding potential,
\&which will lead to extra forces expelling the structure out of the region described
\&by the covariance matrix. If you switch \-restrain the potential is inverted and the structure
\&is kept in that region.
\&


\&The origin is normally the average structure stored in the \fB eigvec.trr\fR file.
\&It can be changed with \fB \-ori\fR to an arbitrary position in configurational space.
\&With \fB \-tau\fR, \fB \-deltaF0\fR, and \fB \-Eflnull\fR you control the flooding behaviour.
\&Efl is the flooding strength, it is updated according to the rule of adaptive flooding.
\&Tau is the time constant of adaptive flooding, high tau means slow adaption (i.e. growth). 
\&DeltaF0 is the flooding strength you want to reach after tau ps of simulation.
\&To use constant Efl set \fB \-tau\fR to zero.
\&


\&\fB \-alpha\fR is a fudge parameter to control the width of the flooding potential. A value of 2 has been found
\&to give good results for most standard cases in flooding of proteins.
\&alpha basically accounts for incomplete sampling, if you sampled further the width of the ensemble would
\&increase, this is mimicked by alpha  1.
\&For restraining, alpha  1 can give you smaller width in the restraining potential.
\&


\&RESTART and FLOODING:
\&If you want to restart a crashed flooding simulation please find the values deltaF and Efl in
\&the output file and manually put them into the \fB .edi\fR file under DELTA_F0 and EFL_NULL.
