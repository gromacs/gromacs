.SH DESCRIPTION
\&ngmx is the Gromacs trajectory viewer. This program reads a
\&trajectory file, a run input file and an index file and plots a
\&3D structure of your molecule on your standard X Window
\&screen. No need for a high end graphics workstation, it even
\&works on Monochrome screens.


\&The following features have been implemented:
\&3D view, rotation, translation and scaling of your molecule(s),
\&labels on atoms, animation of trajectories,
\&hardcopy in PostScript format, user defined atom\-filters
\&runs on MIT\-X (real X), open windows and motif,
\&user friendly menus, option to remove periodicity, option to
\&show computational box.


\&Some of the more common X command line options can be used:

\&\-bg, \-fg change colors, \-font fontname, changes the font.
