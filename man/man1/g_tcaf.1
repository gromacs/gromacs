.SH DESCRIPTION
g_tcaf computes tranverse current autocorrelations.
These are used to estimate the shear viscosity eta.
For details see: Palmer, JCP 49 (1994) pp 359-366.


Transverse currents are calculated using the
k-vectors (1,0,0) and (2,0,0) each also in the y- and z-direction,
(1,1,0) and (1,-1,0) each also in the 2 other plains (these vectors
are not independent) and (1,1,1) and the 3 other box diagonals (also
not independent). For each k-vector the sine and cosine are used, in
combination with the velocity in 2 perpendicular directions. This gives
a total of 16*2*2=64 transverse currents. One autocorrelation is
calculated fitted for each k-vector, which gives 16 tcaf's. Each of
these tcaf's is fitted to f(t) = exp(-v)(cosh(Wv) + 1/W sinh(Wv)),
v = -t/(2 tau), W = sqrt(1 - 4 tau eta/rho k2), which gives 16 tau's
and eta's. The fit weights decay with time as exp(-t/wt), the tcaf and
fit are calculated up to time 5*wt.
The eta's should be fitted to 1 - a eta(k) k2, from which
one can estimate the shear viscosity at k=0.


When the box is cubic, one can use the option 
.B -oc
, which
averages the tcaf's over all k-vectors with the same length.
This results in more accurate tcaf's.
Both the cubic tcaf's and fits are written to 
.B -oc

The cubic eta estimates are also written to 
.B -ov
.


With option 
.B -mol
the transverse current is determined of
molecules instead of atoms. In this case the index group should
consist of molecule numbers instead of atom numbers.


The k-dependent viscosities in the 
.B -ov
file should be
fitted to eta(k) = eta0 (1 - a k2) to obtain the viscosity at
infinite wavelength.


NOTE: make sure you write coordinates and velocities often enough.
The initial, non-exponential, part of the autocorrelation function
is very important for obtaining a good fit.
