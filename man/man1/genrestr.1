.SH DESCRIPTION
genrestr produces an include file for a topology containing
a list of atom numbers and three force constants for the
X, Y and Z direction. A single isotropic force constant may
be given on the command line instead of three components.


WARNING: position restraints only work for the one molecule at a time.
Position restraints are interactions within molecules, therefore
they should be included within the correct 
.B [ moleculetype ]

block in the topology. Since the atom numbers in every moleculetype
in the topology start at 1 and the numbers in the input file for
genpr number consecutively from 1, genpr will only produce a useful
file for the first molecule.


The -of option produces an index file that can be used for
freezing atoms. In this case the input file must be a pdb file.


With the 
.B -disre
option half a matrix of distance restraints
is generated instead of position restraints. With this matrix, that
one typically would apply to C-alpha atoms in a protein, one can
maintain the overall conformation of a protein without tieing it to
a specific position (as with position restraints).

.BI "-n" " index.ndx" 
.B Input, Opt.

.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.BI "-[no]h"  "no    "
 Print help info and quit

.BI "-nice"  " int" " 0" 
 Set the nicelevel

.BI "-fc"  " vector" " 1000 1000 1000" 
 force constants (kJ mol-1 nm-2)

.BI "-freeze"  " real" " 0     " 
 if the -of option or this one is given an index file will be written containing atom numbers of all atoms that have a B-factor less than the level given here

.BI "-[no]disre"  "no    "
 Generate a distance restraint matrix for all the atoms in index

.BI "-disre_dist"  " real" " 0.1   " 
 Distance range around the actual distance for generating distance restraints

.BI "-disre_frac"  " real" " 0     " 
 Fraction of distance to be used as interval rather than a fixed distance. If the fraction of the distance that you specify here is less than the distance given in the previous option, that one is used instead.

.BI "-disre_up2"  " real" " 1     " 
 Distance between upper bound for distance restraints, and the distance at which the force becomes constant (see manual)

.BI "-[no]constr"  "no    "
 Generate a constraint matrix rather than distance restraints
