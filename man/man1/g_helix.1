.SH DESCRIPTION
\&\fB g_helix\fR computes all kinds of helix properties. First, the peptide
\&is checked to find the longest helical part, as determined by
\&hydrogen bonds and phi/psi angles.
\&That bit is fitted
\&to an ideal helix around the \fI z\fR\-axis and centered around the origin.
\&Then the following properties are computed:


\&\fB 1.\fR Helix radius (file \fB radius.xvg\fR). This is merely the
\&RMS deviation in two dimensions for all Calpha atoms.
\&it is calced as sqrt((SUM i(x2(i)+y2(i)))/N), where N is the number
\&of backbone atoms. For an ideal helix the radius is 0.23 nm

\&\fB 2.\fR Twist (file \fB twist.xvg\fR). The average helical angle per
\&residue is calculated. For an alpha\-helix it is 100 degrees,
\&for 3\-10 helices it will be smaller, and 
\&for 5\-helices it will be larger.

\&\fB 3.\fR Rise per residue (file \fB rise.xvg\fR). The helical rise per
\&residue is plotted as the difference in \fI z\fR\-coordinate between Calpha
\&atoms. For an ideal helix, this is 0.15 nm

\&\fB 4.\fR Total helix length (file \fB len\-ahx.xvg\fR). The total length
\&of the
\&helix in nm. This is simply the average rise (see above) times the
\&number of helical residues (see below).

\&\fB 5.\fR Number of helical residues (file \fB n\-ahx.xvg\fR). The title says
\&it all.

\&\fB 6.\fR Helix dipole, backbone only (file \fB dip\-ahx.xvg\fR).

\&\fB 7.\fR RMS deviation from ideal helix, calculated for the Calpha
\&atoms only (file \fB rms\-ahx.xvg\fR).

\&\fB 8.\fR Average Calpha \- Calpha dihedral angle (file \fB phi\-ahx.xvg\fR).

\&\fB 9.\fR Average phi and psi angles (file \fB phipsi.xvg\fR).

\&\fB 10.\fR Ellipticity at 222 nm according to Hirst and Brooks.
