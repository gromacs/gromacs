.SH DESCRIPTION
\&g_helix computes all kind of helix properties. First, the peptide
\&is checked to find the longest helical part. This is determined by
\&Hydrogen bonds and Phi/Psi angles.
\&That bit is fitted
\&to an ideal helix around the Z\-axis and centered around the origin.
\&Then the following properties are computed:


\&\fB 1.\fR Helix radius (file radius.xvg). This is merely the
\&RMS deviation in two dimensions for all Calpha atoms.
\&it is calced as sqrt((SUM i(x2(i)+y2(i)))/N), where N is the number
\&of backbone atoms. For an ideal helix the radius is 0.23 nm

\&\fB 2.\fR Twist (file twist.xvg). The average helical angle per
\&residue is calculated. For alpha helix it is 100 degrees,
\&for 3\-10 helices it will be smaller,
\&for 5\-helices it will be larger.

\&\fB 3.\fR Rise per residue (file rise.xvg). The helical rise per
\&residue is plotted as the difference in Z\-coordinate between Ca
\&atoms. For an ideal helix this is 0.15 nm

\&\fB 4.\fR Total helix length (file len\-ahx.xvg). The total length
\&of the
\&helix in nm. This is simply the average rise (see above) times the
\&number of helical residues (see below).

\&\fB 5.\fR Number of helical residues (file n\-ahx.xvg). The title says
\&it all.

\&\fB 6.\fR Helix Dipole, backbone only (file dip\-ahx.xvg).

\&\fB 7.\fR RMS deviation from ideal helix, calculated for the Calpha
\&atoms only (file rms\-ahx.xvg).

\&\fB 8.\fR Average Calpha\-Calpha dihedral angle (file phi\-ahx.xvg).

\&\fB 9.\fR Average Phi and Psi angles (file phipsi.xvg).

\&\fB 10.\fR Ellipticity at 222 nm according to \fI Hirst and Brooks\fR
\&
