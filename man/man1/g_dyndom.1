.SH DESCRIPTION
\&g_dyndom reads a pdb file output from DynDom
\&http://www.cmp.uea.ac.uk/dyndom/
\&It reads the coordinates, and the coordinates of the rotation axis
\&furthermore it reads an index file containing the domains.
\&Furthermore it takes the first and last atom of the arrow file
\&as command line arguments (head and tail) and
\&finally it takes the translation vector (given in DynDom info file)
\&and the angle of rotation (also as command line arguments). If the angle
\&determined by DynDom is given, one should be able to recover the
\&second structure used for generating the DynDom output.
\&Because of limited numerical accuracy this should be verified by
\&computing an all\-atom RMSD (using \fB g_confrms\fR) rather than by file
\&comparison (using diff).


\&The purpose of this program is to interpolate and extrapolate the
\&rotation as found by DynDom. As a result unphysical structures with
\&long or short bonds, or overlapping atoms may be produced. Visual
\&inspection, and energy minimization may be necessary to
\&validate the structure.
