.SH DESCRIPTION
\&g_dih can do two things. The default is to analyze dihedral transitions
\&by merely computing all the dihedral angles defined in your topology
\&for the whole trajectory. When a dihedral flips over to another minimum
\&an angle/time plot is made.


\&The opther option is to discretize the dihedral space into a number of
\&bins, and group each conformation in dihedral space in the
\&appropriate bin. The output is then given as a number of dihedral
\&conformations sorted according to occupancy.
