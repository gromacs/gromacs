.SH DESCRIPTION
g_sham makes multi-dimensional free-energy, enthalpy and entropy plots.
g_sham reads one or more xvg files and analyzes data sets.
g_sham basic purpose is plotting Gibbs free energy landscapes
(option 
.B -ls
)
by Bolzmann inverting multi-dimensional histograms (option 
.B -lp
)
but it can also
make enthalpy (option 
.B -lsh
) and entropy (option 
.B -lss
)
plots. The histograms can be made for any quantities the user supplies.
A line in the input file may start with a time
(see option 
.B -time
) and any number of y values may follow.
Multiple sets can also be
read when they are seperated by & (option 
.B -n
),
in this case only one y value is read from each line.
All lines starting with  and @ are skipped.



Option 
.B -ge
can be used to supply a file with free energies
when the ensemble is not a Boltzmann ensemble, but needs to be biased
by this free energy. One free energy value is required for each
(multi-dimensional) data point in the 
.B -f
input.



Option 
.B -ene
can be used to supply a file with energies.
These energies are used as a weighting function in the single
histogram analysis method due to Kumar et. al. When also temperatures
are supplied (as a second column in the file) an experimental
weighting scheme is applied. In addition the vales
are used for making enthalpy and entropy plots.



With option 
.B -dim
dimensions can be gives for distances.
When a distance is 2- or 3-dimensional, the circumference or surface
sampled by two particles increases with increasing distance.
Depending on what one would like to show, one can choose to correct
the histogram and free-energy for this volume effect.
The probability is normalized by r and r2 for a dimension of 2 and 3
respectively.
A value of -1 is used to indicate an angle in degrees between two
vectors: a sin(angle) normalization will be applied.
Note that for angles between vectors the inner-product or cosine
is the natural quantity to use, as it will produce bins of the same
volume.
