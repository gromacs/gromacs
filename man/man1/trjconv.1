.SH DESCRIPTION
\&trjconv can convert trajectory files in many ways:

\&\fB 1.\fR from one format to another

\&\fB 2.\fR select a subset of atoms

\&\fB 3.\fR change the periodicity representation

\&\fB 4.\fR keep multimeric molecules together

\&\fB 5.\fR center atoms in the box

\&\fB 6.\fR fit atoms to reference structure

\&\fB 7.\fR reduce the number of frames

\&\fB 8.\fR change the timestamps of the frames 
\&(\fB \-t0\fR and \fB \-timestep\fR)

\&\fB 9.\fR cut the trajectory in small subtrajectories according
\&to information in an index file. This allows subsequent analysis of
\&the subtrajectories that could, for example be the result of a
\&cluster analysis. Use option \fB \-sub\fR.
\&This assumes that the entries in the index file are frame numbers and
\&dumps each group in the index file to a separate trajectory file.

\&\fB 10.\fR select frames within a certain range of a quantity given
\&in an \fB .xvg\fR file.


\&The program \fB trjcat\fR can concatenate multiple trajectory files.
\&


\&Currently seven formats are supported for input and output:
\&\fB .xtc\fR, \fB .trr\fR, \fB .trj\fR, \fB .gro\fR, \fB .g96\fR,
\&\fB .pdb\fR and \fB .g87\fR.
\&The file formats are detected from the file extension.
\&The precision of \fB .xtc\fR and \fB .gro\fR output is taken from the
\&input file for \fB .xtc\fR, \fB .gro\fR and \fB .pdb\fR,
\&and from the \fB \-ndec\fR option for other input formats. The precision
\&is always taken from \fB \-ndec\fR, when this option is set.
\&All other formats have fixed precision. \fB .trr\fR and \fB .trj\fR
\&output can be single or double precision, depending on the precision
\&of the trjconv binary.
\&Note that velocities are only supported in
\&\fB .trr\fR, \fB .trj\fR, \fB .gro\fR and \fB .g96\fR files.


\&Option \fB \-app\fR can be used to
\&append output to an existing trajectory file.
\&No checks are performed to ensure integrity
\&of the resulting combined trajectory file.


\&Option \fB \-sep\fR can be used to write every frame to a separate
\&.gro, .g96 or .pdb file, default all frames all written to one file.
\&\fB .pdb\fR files with all frames concatenated can be viewed with
\&\fB rasmol \-nmrpdb\fR.


\&It is possible to select part of your trajectory and write it out
\&to a new trajectory file in order to save disk space, e.g. for leaving
\&out the water from a trajectory of a protein in water.
\&\fB ALWAYS\fR put the original trajectory on tape!
\&We recommend to use the portable \fB .xtc\fR format for your analysis
\&to save disk space and to have portable files.


\&There are two options for fitting the trajectory to a reference
\&either for essential dynamics analysis or for whatever.
\&The first option is just plain fitting to a reference structure
\&in the structure file, the second option is a progressive fit
\&in which the first timeframe is fitted to the reference structure 
\&in the structure file to obtain and each subsequent timeframe is 
\&fitted to the previously fitted structure. This way a continuous
\&trajectory is generated, which might not be the case when using the
\&regular fit method, e.g. when your protein undergoes large
\&conformational transitions.


\&Option \fB \-pbc\fR sets the type of periodic boundary condition
\&treatment:

\&* \fB mol\fR puts the center of mass of molecules in the box.

\&* \fB res\fR puts the center of mass of residues in the box.

\&* \fB atom\fR puts all the atoms in the box.

\&* \fB nojump\fR checks if atoms jump across the box and then puts
\&them back. This has the effect that all molecules
\&will remain whole (provided they were whole in the initial
\&conformation), note that this ensures a continuous trajectory but
\&molecules may diffuse out of the box. The starting configuration
\&for this procedure is taken from the structure file, if one is
\&supplied, otherwise it is the first frame.

\&* \fB cluster\fR clusters all the atoms in the selected index
\&such that they are all closest to the center of mass of the cluster
\&which is iteratively updated. Note that this will only give meaningful
\&results if you in fact have a cluster. Luckily that can be checked
\&afterwards using a trajectory viewer. Note also that if your molecules
\&are broken this will not work either.

\&* \fB whole\fR only makes broken molecules whole.


\&Option \fB \-ur\fR sets the unit cell representation for options
\&\fB mol\fR, \fB res\fR and \fB atom\fR of \fB \-pbc\fR.
\&All three options give different results for triclinic boxes and
\&identical results for rectangular boxes.
\&\fB rect\fR is the ordinary brick shape.
\&\fB tric\fR is the triclinic unit cell.
\&\fB compact\fR puts all atoms at the closest distance from the center
\&of the box. This can be useful for visualizing e.g. truncated
\&octahedrons. The center for options \fB tric\fR and \fB compact\fR
\&is \fB tric\fR (see below), unless the option \fB \-boxcenter\fR
\&is set differently.


\&Option \fB \-center\fR centers the system in the box. The user can
\&select the group which is used to determine the geometrical center.
\&Option \fB \-boxcenter\fR sets the location of the center of the box
\&for options \fB \-pbc\fR and \fB \-center\fR. The center options are:
\&\fB tric\fR: half of the sum of the box vectors,
\&\fB rect\fR: half of the box diagonal,
\&\fB zero\fR: zero.
\&Use option \fB \-pbc mol\fR in addition to \fB \-center\fR when you
\&want all molecules in the box after the centering.


\&With \fB \-dt\fR it is possible to reduce the number of 
\&frames in the output. This option relies on the accuracy of the times
\&in your input trajectory, so if these are inaccurate use the
\&\fB \-timestep\fR option to modify the time (this can be done
\&simultaneously). For making smooth movies the program \fB g_filter\fR
\&can reduce the number of frames while using low\-pass frequency
\&filtering, this reduces aliasing of high frequency motions.


\&Using \fB \-trunc\fR trjconv can truncate \fB .trj\fR in place, i.e.
\&without copying the file. This is useful when a run has crashed
\&during disk I/O (one more disk full), or when two contiguous
\&trajectories must be concatenated without have double frames.


\&\fB trjcat\fR is more suitable for concatenating trajectory files.


\&Option \fB \-dump\fR can be used to extract a frame at or near
\&one specific time from your trajectory.


\&Option \fB \-drop\fR reads an \fB .xvg\fR file with times and values.
\&When options \fB \-dropunder\fR and/or \fB \-dropover\fR are set,
\&frames with a value below and above the value of the respective options
\&will not be written.
