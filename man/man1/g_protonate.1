.SH DESCRIPTION
\&\fB g_protonate\fR reads (a) conformation(s) and adds all missing
\&hydrogens as defined in \fB gmx2.ff/aminoacids.hdb\fR. If only \fB \-s\fR is
\&specified, this conformation will be protonated, if also \fB \-f\fR
\&is specified, the conformation(s) will be read from this file, 
\&which can be either a single conformation or a trajectory.
\&


\&If a \fB .pdb\fR file is supplied, residue names might not correspond to
\&to the GROMACS naming conventions, in which case these residues will
\&probably not be properly protonated.
\&


\&If an index file is specified, please note that the atom numbers
\&should correspond to the \fB protonated\fR state.
