.SH DESCRIPTION
\&This is an analysis program that implements the Weighted
\&Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM). It is intended to analyze
\&output files generated by umbrella sampling simulations to 
\&compute a potential of mean force (PMF). 


\&At present, three input modes are supported.

\&\fB *\fR With option \fB \-it\fR, the user provides a file which contains the
\& file names of the umbrella simulation run\-input files (\fB .tpr\fR files),
\& AND, with option \fB \-ix\fR, a file which contains file names of
\& the pullx \fB mdrun\fR output files. The \fB .tpr\fR and pullx files must
\& be in corresponding order, i.e. the first \fB .tpr\fR created the
\& first pullx, etc.

\&\fB *\fR Same as the previous input mode, except that the the user
\& provides the pull force output file names (\fB pullf.xvg\fR) with option \fB \-if\fR.
\& From the pull force the position in the umbrella potential is
\& computed. This does not work with tabulated umbrella potentials.
\fB *\fR With option \fB \-ip\fR, the user provides file names of (gzipped) \fB .pdo\fR files, i.e.
\& the GROMACS 3.3 umbrella output files. If you have some unusual reaction coordinate you may also generate your own \fB .pdo\fR files and
\& feed them with the \fB \-ip\fR option into to \fB g_wham\fR. The \fB .pdo\fR file header
\& must be similar to the following:


\&\fB  UMBRELLA      3.0

\& Component selection: 0 0 1

\& nSkip 1

\& Ref. Group 'TestAtom'

\& Nr. of pull groups 2

\& Group 1 'GR1'  Umb. Pos. 5.0 Umb. Cons. 1000.0

\& Group 2 'GR2'  Umb. Pos. 2.0 Umb. Cons. 500.0

\&\fR


\&The number of pull groups, umbrella positions, force constants, and names 
\&may (of course) differ. Following the header, a time column and 
\&a data column for each pull group follows (i.e. the displacement
\&with respect to the umbrella center). Up to four pull groups are possible 
\&per \fB .pdo\fR file at present.


\&By default, the output files are

\&  \fB \-o\fR      PMF output file

\&  \fB \-hist\fR   Histograms output file

\&Always check whether the histograms sufficiently overlap.


\&The umbrella potential is assumed to be harmonic and the force constants are 
\&read from the \fB .tpr\fR or \fB .pdo\fR files. If a non\-harmonic umbrella force was applied 
\&a tabulated potential can be provided with \fB \-tab\fR.


\&WHAM OPTIONS
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

\&  \fB \-bins\fR   Number of bins used in analysis

\&  \fB \-temp\fR   Temperature in the simulations

\&  \fB \-tol\fR    Stop iteration if profile (probability) changed less than tolerance

\&  \fB \-auto\fR   Automatic determination of boundaries

\&  \fB \-min,\-max\fR   Boundaries of the profile 

\&The data points that are used to compute the profile
\&can be restricted with options \fB \-b\fR, \fB \-e\fR, and \fB \-dt\fR. 
\&Adjust \fB \-b\fR to ensure sufficient equilibration in each 
\&umbrella window.


\&With \fB \-log\fR (default) the profile is written in energy units, otherwise 
\&(with \fB \-nolog\fR) as probability. The unit can be specified with \fB \-unit\fR. 
\&With energy output, the energy in the first bin is defined to be zero. 
\&If you want the free energy at a different 
\&position to be zero, set \fB \-zprof0\fR (useful with bootstrapping, see below).


\&For cyclic or periodic reaction coordinates (dihedral angle, channel PMF
\&without osmotic gradient), the option \fB \-cycl\fR is useful. \fB g_wham\fR will make use of the 
\&periodicity of the system and generate a periodic PMF. The first and the last bin of the
\&reaction coordinate will assumed be be neighbors.


\&Option \fB \-sym\fR symmetrizes the profile around z=0 before output, 
\&which may be useful for, e.g. membranes.


\&AUTOCORRELATIONS
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

\&With \fB \-ac\fR, \fB g_wham\fR estimates the integrated autocorrelation 
\&time (IACT) tau for each umbrella window and weights the respective 
\&window with 1/[1+2*tau/dt]. The IACTs are written 
\&to the file defined with \fB \-oiact\fR. In verbose mode, all 
\&autocorrelation functions (ACFs) are written to \fB hist_autocorr.xvg\fR. 
\&Because the IACTs can be severely underestimated in case of limited 
\&sampling, option \fB \-acsig\fR allows one to smooth the IACTs along the 
\&reaction coordinate with a Gaussian (sigma provided with \fB \-acsig\fR, 
\&see output in \fB iact.xvg\fR). Note that the IACTs are estimated by simple 
\&integration of the ACFs while the ACFs are larger 0.05.
\&If you prefer to compute the IACTs by a more sophisticated (but possibly 
\&less robust) method such as fitting to a double exponential, you can 
\&compute the IACTs with \fB g_analyze\fR and provide them to \fB g_wham\fR with the file 
\&\fB iact\-in.dat\fR (option \fB \-iiact\fR), which should contain one line per 
\&input file (\fB .pdo\fR or pullx/f file) and one column per pull group in the respective file.


\&ERROR ANALYSIS
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

\&Statistical errors may be estimated with bootstrap analysis. Use it with care, 
\&otherwise the statistical error may be substantially underestimated. 
\&More background and examples for the bootstrap technique can be found in 
\&Hub, de Groot and Van der Spoel, JCTC (2010) 6: 3713\-3720.

\&\fB \-nBootstrap\fR defines the number of bootstraps (use, e.g., 100). 
\&Four bootstrapping methods are supported and 
\&selected with \fB \-bs\-method\fR.

\&  (1) \fB b\-hist\fR   Default: complete histograms are considered as independent 
\&data points, and the bootstrap is carried out by assigning random weights to the 
\&histograms ("Bayesian bootstrap"). Note that each point along the reaction coordinate
\&must be covered by multiple independent histograms (e.g. 10 histograms), otherwise the 
\&statistical error is underestimated.

\&  (2) \fB hist\fR    Complete histograms are considered as independent data points. 
\&For each bootstrap, N histograms are randomly chosen from the N given histograms 
\&(allowing duplication, i.e. sampling with replacement).
\&To avoid gaps without data along the reaction coordinate blocks of histograms 
\&(\fB \-histbs\-block\fR) may be defined. In that case, the given histograms are 
\&divided into blocks and only histograms within each block are mixed. Note that 
\&the histograms within each block must be representative for all possible histograms, 
\&otherwise the statistical error is underestimated.

\&  (3) \fB traj\fR  The given histograms are used to generate new random trajectories,
\&such that the generated data points are distributed according the given histograms 
\&and properly autocorrelated. The autocorrelation time (ACT) for each window must be 
\&known, so use \fB \-ac\fR or provide the ACT with \fB \-iiact\fR. If the ACT of all 
\&windows are identical (and known), you can also provide them with \fB \-bs\-tau\fR. 
\&Note that this method may severely underestimate the error in case of limited sampling, 
\&that is if individual histograms do not represent the complete phase space at 
\&the respective positions.

\&  (4) \fB traj\-gauss\fR  The same as method \fB traj\fR, but the trajectories are 
\&not bootstrapped from the umbrella histograms but from Gaussians with the average 
\&and width of the umbrella histograms. That method yields similar error estimates 
\&like method \fB traj\fR.

Bootstrapping output:

\&  \fB \-bsres\fR   Average profile and standard deviations

\&  \fB \-bsprof\fR  All bootstrapping profiles

\&With \fB \-vbs\fR (verbose bootstrapping), the histograms of each bootstrap are written, 
\&and, with bootstrap method \fB traj\fR, the cumulative distribution functions of 
\&the histograms.
