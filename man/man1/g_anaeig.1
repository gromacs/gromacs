.SH DESCRIPTION
\&\fB g_anaeig\fR analyzes eigenvectors. The eigenvectors can be of a
\&covariance matrix (\fB g_covar\fR) or of a Normal Modes analysis
\&(\fB g_nmeig\fR).


\&When a trajectory is projected on eigenvectors, all structures are
\&fitted to the structure in the eigenvector file, if present, otherwise
\&to the structure in the structure file. When no run input file is
\&supplied, periodicity will not be taken into account. Most analyses
\&are performed on eigenvectors \fB \-first\fR to \fB \-last\fR, but when
\&\fB \-first\fR is set to \-1 you will be prompted for a selection.


\&\fB \-comp\fR: plot the vector components per atom of eigenvectors
\&\fB \-first\fR to \fB \-last\fR.


\&\fB \-rmsf\fR: plot the RMS fluctuation per atom of eigenvectors
\&\fB \-first\fR to \fB \-last\fR (requires \fB \-eig\fR).


\&\fB \-proj\fR: calculate projections of a trajectory on eigenvectors
\&\fB \-first\fR to \fB \-last\fR.
\&The projections of a trajectory on the eigenvectors of its
\&covariance matrix are called principal components (pc's).
\&It is often useful to check the cosine content of the pc's,
\&since the pc's of random diffusion are cosines with the number
\&of periods equal to half the pc index.
\&The cosine content of the pc's can be calculated with the program
\&\fB g_analyze\fR.


\&\fB \-2d\fR: calculate a 2d projection of a trajectory on eigenvectors
\&\fB \-first\fR and \fB \-last\fR.


\&\fB \-3d\fR: calculate a 3d projection of a trajectory on the first
\&three selected eigenvectors.


\&\fB \-filt\fR: filter the trajectory to show only the motion along
\&eigenvectors \fB \-first\fR to \fB \-last\fR.


\&\fB \-extr\fR: calculate the two extreme projections along a trajectory
\&on the average structure and interpolate \fB \-nframes\fR frames
\&between them, or set your own extremes with \fB \-max\fR. The
\&eigenvector \fB \-first\fR will be written unless \fB \-first\fR and
\&\fB \-last\fR have been set explicitly, in which case all eigenvectors
\&will be written to separate files. Chain identifiers will be added
\&when writing a \fB .pdb\fR file with two or three structures (you
\&can use \fB rasmol \-nmrpdb\fR to view such a pdb file).


\&  Overlap calculations between covariance analysis:

\&  NOTE: the analysis should use the same fitting structure


\&\fB \-over\fR: calculate the subspace overlap of the eigenvectors in
\&file \fB \-v2\fR with eigenvectors \fB \-first\fR to \fB \-last\fR
\&in file \fB \-v\fR.


\&\fB \-inpr\fR: calculate a matrix of inner\-products between
\&eigenvectors in files \fB \-v\fR and \fB \-v2\fR. All eigenvectors
\&of both files will be used unless \fB \-first\fR and \fB \-last\fR
\&have been set explicitly.


\&When \fB \-v\fR, \fB \-eig\fR, \fB \-v2\fR and \fB \-eig2\fR are given,
\&a single number for the overlap between the covariance matrices is
\&generated. The formulas are:

\&        difference = sqrt(tr((sqrt(M1) \- sqrt(M2))2))

\&normalized overlap = 1 \- difference/sqrt(tr(M1) + tr(M2))

\&     shape overlap = 1 \- sqrt(tr((sqrt(M1/tr(M1)) \- sqrt(M2/tr(M2)))2))

\&where M1 and M2 are the two covariance matrices and tr is the trace
\&of a matrix. The numbers are proportional to the overlap of the square
\&root of the fluctuations. The normalized overlap is the most useful
\&number, it is 1 for identical matrices and 0 when the sampled
\&subspaces are orthogonal.


\&When the \fB \-entropy\fR flag is given an entropy estimate will be
\&computed based on the Quasiharmonic approach and based on
\&Schlitter's formula.
