.SH DESCRIPTION
\&For a given number \fB \-np\fR or \fB \-nt\fR of processors/threads, this program systematically
\&times \fB mdrun\fR with various numbers of PME\-only nodes and determines
\&which setting is fastest. It will also test whether performance can
\&be enhanced by shifting load from the reciprocal to the real space
\&part of the Ewald sum. 
\&Simply pass your \fB .tpr\fR file to \fB g_tune_pme\fR together with other options
\&for \fB mdrun\fR as needed.


\&Which executables are used can be set in the environment variables
\&MPIRUN and MDRUN. If these are not present, 'mpirun' and 'mdrun'
\&will be used as defaults. Note that for certain MPI frameworks you
\&need to provide a machine\- or hostfile. This can also be passed
\&via the MPIRUN variable, e.g.


\&\fB export MPIRUN="/usr/local/mpirun \-machinefile hosts"\fR


\&Please call \fB g_tune_pme\fR with the normal options you would pass to
\&\fB mdrun\fR and add \fB \-np\fR for the number of processors to perform the
\&tests on, or \fB \-nt\fR for the number of threads. You can also add \fB \-r\fR
\&to repeat each test several times to get better statistics. 


\&\fB g_tune_pme\fR can test various real space / reciprocal space workloads
\&for you. With \fB \-ntpr\fR you control how many extra \fB .tpr\fR files will be
\&written with enlarged cutoffs and smaller fourier grids respectively.
\&Typically, the first test (number 0) will be with the settings from the input
\&\fB .tpr\fR file; the last test (number \fB ntpr\fR) will have cutoffs multiplied
\&by (and at the same time fourier grid dimensions divided by) the scaling
\&factor \fB \-fac\fR (default 1.2). The remaining \fB .tpr\fR files will have about 
\&equally\-spaced values in between these extremes. \fB Note\fR that you can set \fB \-ntpr\fR to 1
\&if you just want to find the optimal number of PME\-only nodes; in that case
\&your input \fB .tpr\fR file will remain unchanged.


\&For the benchmark runs, the default of 1000 time steps should suffice for most
\&MD systems. The dynamic load balancing needs about 100 time steps
\&to adapt to local load imbalances, therefore the time step counters
\&are by default reset after 100 steps. For large systems
\&(1M atoms) you may have to set \fB \-resetstep\fR to a higher value.
\&From the 'DD' load imbalance entries in the md.log output file you
\&can tell after how many steps the load is sufficiently balanced. Example call:

\fB g_tune_pme \-np 64 \-s protein.tpr \-launch\fR


\&After calling \fB mdrun\fR several times, detailed performance information
\&is available in the output file \fB perf.out.\fR 
\&\fB Note\fR that during the benchmarks, a couple of temporary files are written
\&(options \fB \-b\fR*), these will be automatically deleted after each test.


\&If you want the simulation to be started automatically with the
\&optimized parameters, use the command line option \fB \-launch\fR.
