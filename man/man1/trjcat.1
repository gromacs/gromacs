.SH DESCRIPTION
\&trjcat concatenates several input trajectory files in sorted order. 
\&In case of double time frames the one in the later file is used. 
\&By specifying \fB \-settime\fR you will be asked for the start time 
\&of each file. The input files are taken from the command line, 
\&such that a command like \fB trjcat \-o fixed.trr *.trr\fR should do 
\&the trick. Using \fB \-cat\fR you can simply paste several files 
\&together without removal of frames with identical time stamps.


\&One important option is inferred when the output file is amongst the
\&input files. In that case that particular file will be appended to
\&which implies you do not need to store double the amount of data.
\&Obviously the file to append to has to be the one with lowest starting
\&time since one can only append at the end of a file.


\&If the \fB \-demux\fR option is given, the N trajectories that are
\&read, are written in another order as specified in the xvg file.
\&The xvg file should contain something like:


\&0  0  1  2  3  4  5

\&2  1  0  2  3  5  4

\&Where the first number is the time, and subsequent numbers point to
\&trajectory indices.
\&The frames corresponding to the numbers present at the first line
\&are collected into the output trajectory. If the number of frames in
\&the trajectory does not match that in the xvg file then the program
\&tries to be smart. Beware.
