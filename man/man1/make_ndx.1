.SH DESCRIPTION
\&Index groups are necessary for almost every gromacs program.
\&All these programs can generate default index groups. You ONLY
\&have to use make_ndx when you need SPECIAL index groups.
\&There is a default index group for the whole system, 9 default
\&index groups are generated for proteins, a default index group
\&is generated for every other residue name.


\&When no index file is supplied, also make_ndx will generate the
\&default groups.
\&With the index editor you can select on atom, residue and chain names
\&and numbers.
\&When a run input file is supplied you can also select on atom type.
\&You can use NOT, AND and OR, you can split groups
\&into chains, residues or atoms. You can delete and rename groups.


\&The atom numbering in the editor and the index file starts at 1.
