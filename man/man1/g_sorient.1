.SH DESCRIPTION
\&\fB g_sorient\fR analyzes solvent orientation around solutes.
\&It calculates two angles between the vector from one or more
\&reference positions to the first atom of each solvent molecule:


\&theta_1: the angle with the vector from the first atom of the solvent
\&molecule to the midpoint between atoms 2 and 3.

\&theta_2: the angle with the normal of the solvent plane, defined by the
\&same three atoms, or, when the option \fB \-v23\fR is set, 
\&the angle with the vector between atoms 2 and 3.


\&The reference can be a set of atoms or
\&the center of mass of a set of atoms. The group of solvent atoms should
\&consist of 3 atoms per solvent molecule.
\&Only solvent molecules between \fB \-rmin\fR and \fB \-rmax\fR are
\&considered for \fB \-o\fR and \fB \-no\fR each frame.


\&\fB \-o\fR: distribtion of cos(theta_1) for rmin=r=rmax.


\&\fB \-no\fR: distribution of cos(theta_2) for rmin=r=rmax.


\&\fB \-ro\fR: cos(theta_1) and 3cos(2theta_2)\-1 as a function of the
\&distance.


\&\fB \-co\fR: the sum over all solvent molecules within distance r
\&of cos(theta_1) and 3cos(2(theta_2)\-1) as a function of r.


\&\fB \-rc\fR: the distribution of the solvent molecules as a function of r
