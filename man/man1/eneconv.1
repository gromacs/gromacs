.SH DESCRIPTION
\&With \fI multiple files\fR specified for the \fB \-f\fR option:

\&Concatenates several energy files in sorted order.
\&In case of double time frames the one
\&in the later file is used. By specifying \fB \-settime\fR you will be
\&asked for the start time of each file. The input files are taken
\&from the command line,
\&such that the command \fB eneconv \-o fixed.edr *.edr\fR should do
\&the trick. 


\&With \fI one file\fR specified for \fB \-f\fR:

\&Reads one energy file and writes another, applying the \fB \-dt\fR,
\&\fB \-offset\fR, \fB \-t0\fR and \fB \-settime\fR options and
\&converting to a different format if necessary (indicated by file
\&extentions).


\&\fB \-settime\fR is applied first, then \fB \-dt\fR/\fB \-offset\fR
\&followed by \fB \-b\fR and \fB \-e\fR to select which frames to write.
.SH FILES
.BI "\-f" " ener.edr" 
.B Input, Mult.
 Energy file 

.BI "\-o" " fixed.edr" 
.B Output
 Energy file 

.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.BI "\-[no]h"  "no    "
 Print help info and quit

.BI "\-[no]version"  "no    "
 Print version info and quit

.BI "\-nice"  " int" " 19" 
 Set the nicelevel

.BI "\-b"  " real" " \-1    " 
 First time to use

.BI "\-e"  " real" " \-1    " 
 Last time to use

.BI "\-dt"  " real" " 0     " 
 Only write out frame when t MOD dt = offset

.BI "\-offset"  " real" " 0     " 
 Time offset for \-dt option

.BI "\-[no]settime"  "no    "
 Change starting time interactively

.BI "\-[no]sort"  "yes   "
 Sort energy files (not frames)

.BI "\-scalefac"  " real" " 1     " 
 Multiply energy component by this factor

.BI "\-[no]error"  "yes   "
 Stop on errors in the file

.SH KNOWN PROBLEMS
\- When combining trajectories the sigma and E2 (necessary for statistics) are not updated correctly. Only the actual energy is correct. One thus has to compute statistics in another way.
