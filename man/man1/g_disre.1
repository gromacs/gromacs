.SH DESCRIPTION
\&\fB g_disre\fR computes violations of distance restraints.
\&If necessary, all protons can be added to a protein molecule 
\&using the \fB g_protonate\fR program.


\&The program always
\&computes the instantaneous violations rather than time\-averaged,
\&because this analysis is done from a trajectory file afterwards
\&it does not make sense to use time averaging. However,
\&the time averaged values per restraint are given in the log file.


\&An index file may be used to select specific restraints for
\&printing.


\&When the optional \fB \-q\fR flag is given a \fB .pdb\fR file coloured by the
\&amount of average violations.


\&When the \fB \-c\fR option is given, an index file will be read
\&containing the frames in your trajectory corresponding to the clusters
\&(defined in another manner) that you want to analyze. For these clusters
\&the program will compute average violations using the third power
\&averaging algorithm and print them in the log file.
