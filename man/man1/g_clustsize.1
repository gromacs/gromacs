.SH DESCRIPTION
\&This program computes the size distributions of molecular/atomic clusters in
\&the gas phase. The output is given in the form of an \fB .xpm\fR file.
\&The total number of clusters is written to an \fB .xvg\fR file.


\&When the \fB \-mol\fR option is given clusters will be made out of
\&molecules rather than atoms, which allows clustering of large molecules.
\&In this case an index file would still contain atom numbers
\&or your calculation will die with a SEGV.


\&When velocities are present in your trajectory, the temperature of
\&the largest cluster will be printed in a separate \fB .xvg\fR file assuming
\&that the particles are free to move. If you are using constraints,
\&please correct the temperature. For instance water simulated with SHAKE
\&or SETTLE will yield a temperature that is 1.5 times too low. You can
\&compensate for this with the \fB \-ndf\fR option. Remember to take the removal
\&of center of mass motion into account.


\&The \fB \-mc\fR option will produce an index file containing the
\&atom numbers of the largest cluster.
