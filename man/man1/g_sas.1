.SH DESCRIPTION
\&g_sas computes hydrophobic, hydrophilic and total solvent accessible surface area.
\&As a side effect the Connolly surface can be generated as well in
\&a pdb file where the nodes are represented as atoms and the vertices
\&connecting the nearest nodes as CONECT records.
\&The program will ask for a group for the surface calculation
\&and a group for the output. The calculation group should always
\&consists of all the non\-solvent atoms in the system.
\&The output group can be the whole or part of the calculation group.
\&The area can be plotted
\&per residue and atom as well (options \fB \-or\fR and \fB \-oa\fR).
\&In combination with the latter option an \fB itp\fR file can be
\&generated (option \fB \-i\fR)
\&which can be used to restrain surface atoms.


\&By default, periodic boundary conditions are taken into account,
\&this can be turned off using the \fB \-nopbc\fR option.


\&With the \fB \-tv\fR option the total volume and density of the molecule can be
\&computed.
\&Please consider whether the normal probe radius is appropriate
\&in this case or whether you would rather use e.g. 0. It is good
\&to keep in mind that the results for volume and density are very
\&approximate, in e.g. ice Ih one can easily fit water molecules in the
\&pores which would yield too low volume, too high surface area and too
\&high density.
