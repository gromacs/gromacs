.SH DESCRIPTION
\&g_msd computes the mean square displacement (MSD) of atoms from
\&a set of initial positions. This provides an easy way to compute
\&the diffusion constant using the Einstein relation.
\&The time between the reference points for the MSD calculation
\&is set with \fB \-trestart\fR.
\&The diffusion constant is calculated by least squares fitting a
\&straight line (D*t + c) through the MSD(t) from \fB \-beginfit\fR to
\&\fB \-endfit\fR (note that t is time from the reference positions,
\&not simulation time). An error estimate given, which is the difference
\&of the diffusion coefficients obtained from fits over the two halves
\&of the fit interval.


\&There are three, mutually exclusive, options to determine different
\&types of mean square displacement: \fB \-type\fR, \fB \-lateral\fR
\&and \fB \-ten\fR. Option \fB \-ten\fR writes the full MSD tensor for
\&each group, the order in the output is: trace xx yy zz yx zx zy.


\&If \fB \-mol\fR is set, g_msd plots the MSD for individual molecules: 
\&for each individual molecule a diffusion constant is computed for 
\&its center of mass. The chosen index group will be split into 
\&molecules.


\&The default way to calculate a MSD is by using mass\-weighted averages.
\&This can be turned off with \fB \-nomw\fR.


\&With the option \fB \-rmcomm\fR, the center of mass motion of a 
\&specific group can be removed. For trajectories produced with 
\&GROMACS this is usually not necessary, 
\&as mdrun usually already removes the center of mass motion.
\&When you use this option be sure that the whole system is stored
\&in the trajectory file.


\&The diffusion coefficient is determined by linear regression of the MSD,
\&where, unlike for the normal output of D, the times are weighted
\&according to the number of reference points, i.e. short times have
\&a higher weight. Also when \fB \-beginfit\fR=\-1,fitting starts at 10%
\&and when \fB \-endfit\fR=\-1, fitting goes to 90%.
\&Using this option one also gets an accurate error estimate
\&based on the statistics between individual molecules.
\&Note that this diffusion coefficient and error estimate are only
\&accurate when the MSD is completely linear between
\&\fB \-beginfit\fR and \fB \-endfit\fR.


\&Option \fB \-pdb\fR writes a pdb file with the coordinates of the frame
\&at time \fB \-tpdb\fR with in the B\-factor field the square root of
\&the diffusion coefficient of the molecule.
\&This option implies option \fB \-mol\fR.
