.SH DESCRIPTION
\&\fB g_rmsdist\fR computes the root mean square deviation of atom distances,
\&which has the advantage that no fit is needed like in standard RMS
\&deviation as computed by \fB g_rms\fR.
\&The reference structure is taken from the structure file.
\&The RMSD at time t is calculated as the RMS
\&of the differences in distance between atom\-pairs in the reference
\&structure and the structure at time t.


\&\fB g_rmsdist\fR can also produce matrices of the rms distances, rms distances
\&scaled with the mean distance and the mean distances and matrices with
\&NMR averaged distances (1/r3 and 1/r6 averaging). Finally, lists
\&of atom pairs with 1/r3 and 1/r6 averaged distance below the
\&maximum distance (\fB \-max\fR, which will default to 0.6 in this case)
\&can be generated, by default averaging over equivalent hydrogens
\&(all triplets of hydrogens named *[123]). Additionally a list of
\&equivalent atoms can be supplied (\fB \-equiv\fR), each line containing
\&a set of equivalent atoms specified as residue number and name and
\&atom name; e.g.:


\&\fB 3 SER  HB1 3 SER  HB2\fR


\&Residue and atom names must exactly match those in the structure
\&file, including case. Specifying non\-sequential atoms is undefined.
