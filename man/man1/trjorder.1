.SH DESCRIPTION
\&trjorder orders molecules according to the smallest distance
\&to atoms in a reference group
\&or on z\-coordinate (with option \fB \-z\fR).
\&With distance ordering, it will ask for a group of reference
\&atoms and a group of molecules. For each frame of the trajectory
\&the selected molecules will be reordered according to the shortest
\&distance between atom number \fB \-da\fR in the molecule and all the
\&atoms in the reference group. The center of mass of the molecules can
\&be used instead of a reference atom by setting \fB \-da\fR to 0.
\&All atoms in the trajectory are written
\&to the output trajectory.


\&trjorder can be useful for e.g. analyzing the n waters closest to a
\&protein.
\&In that case the reference group would be the protein and the group
\&of molecules would consist of all the water atoms. When an index group
\&of the first n waters is made, the ordered trajectory can be used
\&with any Gromacs program to analyze the n closest waters.
\&


\&If the output file is a pdb file, the distance to the reference target
\&will be stored in the B\-factor field in order to color with e.g. rasmol.
\&


\&With option \fB \-nshell\fR the number of molecules within a shell
\&of radius \fB \-r\fR around the reference group are printed.
