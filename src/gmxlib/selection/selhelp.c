    "If both options are specified, [TT]-select[tt] takes precedence.",

    "directory, it is used instead of the one provided by default.[PAR]",

    "Depending on the tool, two additional command-line arguments may be",

    "This can be used to optimize the selections: you should write the",
    "most restrictive and/or the most inexpensive expressions first in",
    "boolean expressions.",
    "The relative ordering between dynamic and static expressions does not",
    "matter: all static expressions are evaluated only once, before the first",
    "frame, and the result becomes the leftmost expression.[PAR]",

    "Another point for optimization is in common subexpressions: they are not",
    "automatically recognized, but can be manually optimized by the use of",
    "variables. This can have a big impact on the performance of complex",
    "selections, in particular if you define several index groups like this:",

    "times, although they are exactly the same within each selection.",
    "Anything assigned into a variable becomes a common subexpression that",
    "is evaluated only once during a frame.",
    "Currently, in some cases the use of variables can actually lead to a small",
    "performance loss because of the checks necessary to determine for which",

    "For such programs, it is up to the user to provide a proper selection",

    "When [TT]name[tt] selection keyword is used together with PDB input",

    "file, 4 character atom names that start with a digit are transformed",
    "such that, e.g., 1HG2 becomes HG21, and the latter is what is matched",

    "Possible ways of specifying positions in selections are:[PAR]",

    "1. A constant position can be defined as [TT][XX, YY, ZZ][tt], where",
    "[TT]XX[tt], [TT]YY[tt] and [TT]ZZ[tt] are real numbers.[PAR]",

    "2. [TT]com of ATOM_EXPR [pbc][tt] or [TT]cog of ATOM_EXPR [pbc][tt]",
    "calculate the center of mass/geometry of [TT]ATOM_EXPR[tt]. If",
    "[TT]pbc[tt] is specified, the center is calculated iteratively to try",
    "to deal with cases where [TT]ATOM_EXPR[tt] wraps around periodic",
    "boundary conditions.[PAR]",

    "3. [TT]POSTYPE of ATOM_EXPR[tt] calculates the specified positions for",
    "the atoms in [TT]ATOM_EXPR[tt].",
    "[TT]POSTYPE[tt] can be [TT]atom[tt], [TT]res_com[tt], [TT]res_cog[tt],",
    "[TT]mol_com[tt] or [TT]mol_cog[tt], with an optional prefix [TT]whole_[tt]",
    "[TT]part_[tt] or [TT]dyn_[tt].",
    "[TT]whole_[tt] calculates the centers for the whole residue/molecule,",
    "even if only part of it is selected.",
    "[TT]part_[tt] prefix calculates the centers for the selected atoms, but",
    "uses always the same atoms for the same residue/molecule. The used atoms",
    "are determined from the the largest group allowed by the selection.",
    "[TT]dyn_[tt] calculates the centers strictly only for the selected atoms.",
    "If no prefix is specified, whole selections default to [TT]part_[tt] and",
    "other places default to [TT]whole_[tt].",
    "The latter is often desirable to select the same molecules in different",
    "tools, while the first is a compromise between speed ([TT]dyn_[tt]",
    "positions can be slower to evaluate than [TT]part_[tt]) and intuitive",
    "behavior.[PAR]",

    "4. [TT]ATOM_EXPR[tt], when given for whole selections, is handled as 3.",

    "[TT]-seltype[tt].[PAR]",

    "Selection keywords that select atoms based on their positions, such as",
    "[TT]dist from[tt], use by default the positions defined by the",
    "[TT]-selrpos[tt] command-line option.",
    "This can be overridden by prepending a [TT]POSTYPE[tt] specifier to the",
    "keyword. For example, [TT]res_com dist from POS[tt] evaluates the",
    "residue center of mass distances. In the example, all atoms of a residue",
    "are either selected or not, based on the single distance calculated.",
};

static const char *help_syntax[] = {
    "SELECTION SYNTAX[PAR]",

    "A set of selections consists of one or more selections, separated by",
    "semicolons. Each selection defines a set of positions for the analysis.",
    "Each selection can also be preceded by a string that gives a name for",
    "the selection for use in, e.g., graph legends.",
    "If no name is provided, the string used for the selection is used",
    "automatically as the name.[PAR]",

    "For interactive input, the syntax is slightly altered: line breaks can",
    "also be used to separate selections. \\ followed by a line break can",
    "be used to continue a line if necessary.",
    "Notice that the above only applies to real interactive input,",
    "not if you provide the selections, e.g., from a pipe.[PAR]",

    "It is possible to use variables to store selection expressions.",
    "A variable is defined with the following syntax:[BR]",
    "[TT]VARNAME = EXPR ;[tt][BR]",
    "where [TT]EXPR[tt] is any valid selection expression.",
    "After this, [TT]VARNAME[tt] can be used anywhere where [TT]EXPR[tt]",
    "would be valid.[PAR]",

    "Selections are composed of three main types of expressions, those that",
    "define atoms ([TT]ATOM_EXPR[tt]s), those that define positions",
    "([TT]POS_EXPR[tt]s), and those that evaluate to numeric values",
    "([TT]NUM_EXPR[tt]s). Each selection should be a [TT]POS_EXPR[tt]",
    "or a [TT]ATOM_EXPR[tt] (the latter is automatically converted to",
    "positions). The basic rules are as follows:[BR]",
    "1. An expression like [TT]NUM_EXPR1 < NUM_EXPR2[tt] evaluates to an",
    "[TT]ATOM_EXPR[tt] that selects all the atoms for which the comparison",
    "is true.[BR]",
    "2. Atom expressions can be combined with gmx_boolean operations such as",
    "[TT]not ATOM_EXPR[tt], [TT]ATOM_EXPR and ATOM_EXPR[tt], or",
    "[TT]ATOM_EXPR or ATOM_EXPR[tt]. Parentheses can be used to alter the",
    "evaluation order.[BR]",
    "3. [TT]ATOM_EXPR[tt] expressions can be converted into [TT]POS_EXPR[tt]",
    "expressions in various ways, see \"help positions\" for more details.[PAR]",

    "Some keywords select atoms based on string values such as the atom name.",
    "For these keywords, it is possible to use wildcards ([TT]name \"C*\"[tt])",
    "or regular expressions (e.g., [TT]resname \"R[AB]\"[tt]).",
    "The match type is automatically guessed from the string: if it contains",
    "other characters than letters, numbers, '*', or '?', it is interpreted",
    "as a regular expression.",
    "Strings that contain non-alphanumeric characters should be enclosed in",
    "double quotes as in the examples. For other strings, the quotes are",
    "optional, but if the value conflicts with a reserved keyword, a syntax",
    "error will occur. If your strings contain uppercase letters, this should",
    "not happen.[PAR]",

    "Index groups provided with the [TT]-n[tt] command-line option or",
    "generated by default can be accessed with [TT]group NR[tt] or",
    "[TT]group NAME[tt], where [TT]NR[tt] is a zero-based index of the group",
    "and [TT]NAME[tt] is part of the name of the desired group.",
    "The keyword [TT]group[tt] is optional if the whole selection is",
