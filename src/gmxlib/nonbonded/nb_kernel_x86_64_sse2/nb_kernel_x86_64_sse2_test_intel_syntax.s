;# These files require GNU binutils 2.10 or later, since we
;# use intel syntax for portability, or a recent version 
;# of NASM that understands Extended 3DNow and SSE2 instructions.
;# (NASM is normally only used with MS Visual C++).
;# Since NASM and gnu as disagree on some definitions and use 
;# completely different preprocessing options I have to introduce a
;# trick: NASM uses ';' for comments, while gnu as uses '#' on x86.
;# Gnu as treats ';' as a line break, i.e. ignores it. This is the
;# reason why all comments need both symbols...
;# The source is written for GNU as, with intel syntax. When you use
;# NASM we redefine a couple of things. The false if-statement around 
;# the following code is seen by GNU as, but NASM doesn't see it, so 
;# the code inside is read by NASM but not gcc.
