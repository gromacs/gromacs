/* Normally, DSTEVR is the LAPACK wrapper which calls one
 * of the eigenvalue methods. However, our code includes a
 * version of DSTEGR which is never than LAPACK 3.0 and can
 * handle requests for a subset of eigenvalues/vectors too,
 * and it should not need to call DSTEIN.
 * Just in case somebody has a faster version in their lapack
 * library we still call the driver routine, but in our own
 * case this is just a wrapper to dstegr.
