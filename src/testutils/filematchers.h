 * Represents a file matcher, matching file contents against reference (or
 * other) data.
 *
 * Typical pattern of declaring such matchers is to
 *  - Create a factory that implements IFileMatcherSettings,
 *  - Make that factory provide any necessary parameters that the matcher needs,
 *    using a "named parameter" idiom (see XvgMatch for an example), and
 *  - Make the factory create and return an instance of an internal
 *    implementation class that implements IFileMatcher and provides
 *    the actual matching logic.
 *
 * Any method that then wants to accept a matcher can accept a
 * IFileMatcherSettings.
