/*! \libinternal \brief
 * Helper for tests that need input and output files.
 *
 * To be used as a member in a test fixture class, this class provides
 * getTemporaryFilePath() method that returns a path for creating file names
 * for temporary files.  The returned path contains the name of the running
 * test, making it unique across tests.  Additionally, this class takes care of
 * removing any temporary files (i.e., all paths returned by
 * getTemporaryFilePath()) at test teardown (i.e., when the
 * TestFileManager is destructed).
 *
 * In addition, class-level static accessors provide means to
 * access data files that are located in the test source directory.
 * This is used to provide input files for the tests, and also to
 * store test reference data persistently (see TestReferenceData).
 *
 * Note that setInputDataDirectory(), setTestSimulationDataBaseDirectory() and
 * setGlobalOutputTempDirectory() must be called in setup code, before
 * creating any objects of this class that are used for accessing the
 * paths for these respective directories. Code in tests should avoid
 * calling setGlobalOutputTempDirectory(), and instead instantiate an
 * object and use setOutputTempDirectory(), so that the global state
 * is not changed.
