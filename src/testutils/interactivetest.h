/*! \libinternal \brief
 * Helper class for testing interactive sessions.
 *
 * The calling test can set the user input using setInputLines() (and possibly
 * setLastNewline()), pass the streams from inputStream() and outputStream() to
 * the code that executes the interactive session, and then call checkSession()
 * after the session is finished.
 * The input is provided from the array set with setInputLines(), and all
 * output is checked using the reference data framework.
 * The reference XML data can be viewed with the XSLT stylesheet to show
 * exactly how the session went.
