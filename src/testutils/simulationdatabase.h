 * An internal database of several kinds of simulation useful for such
 * comparisons is available, whose \c simulationName keys are
 *     - argon12
 *     - argon5832
 *     - tip3p5
 *     - spc2

 *     - glycine_vacuo
 *     - glycine_no_constraints_vacuo
 *     - nonanol_vacuo
 *
 * Some of these systems are pretty minimal, because having
 * few atoms means few interactions, highly reproducible
 * forces, and allows tests to focus on the correctness of the
 * implementation of high-level mdrun features. The boxes are
 * of a reasonable size so that domain decomposition is
 * possible. The pressure-coupling parameters are isotropic,
 * and set up so that there will not be dramatic collapse of
 * volume over the handful of MD steps that will be run. A
 * single temperature-coupling group is used.
