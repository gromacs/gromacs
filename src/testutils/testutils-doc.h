 * \brief
 * Common helper classes and functions for writing tests using Google Test.
 *
 * General documentation for the testing in \Gromacs can be found in the
 * \linktodevmanual{index,developer guide}.  This page provides an overview of
 * the actual API provided by the `testutils` module.
 *
 * There are several distinct functionalities provided:
 *  - gmx::test::TestFileManager (in testfilemanager.h) provides functionality
 *    for locating test input files from the source directory and managing
 *    temporary files that need to be created during the test.
 *  - gmx::test::TestFileInputRedirector (in testfileredirector.h) provides
 *    functionality for capturing file existence checks in code that uses
 *    gmx::IFileInputRedirector.
 *  - gmx::test::TestFileOutputRedirector (in testfileredirector.h) provides
 *    functionality for capturing file output (including `stdout`) from code
 *    that uses gmx::IFileOutputRedirector, and checking that output
 *    against reference data.
 *  - gmx::test::InteractiveTestHelper (in interactivetest.h) provides
 *    a helper class for testing an interactive session that uses
 *    gmx::TextInputStream and gmx::TextOutputStream for prompting input and
 *    printing status messages.
 *  - #GMX_TEST_OPTIONS macro provides facilities for adding custom command
 *    line options for the test binary.
 *  - testasserts.h provides several custom test assertions for better
 *    exception and floating-point handling than built-in Google Test
 *    assertions.
 *  - gmx::test::TestReferenceData and related classes (in refdata.h) provide
 *    utilities to write regression-style tests that check that the test
 *    produces the same results as an earlier run of the same test.
 *    See \ref page_refdata for more details.
 *  - gmx::test::CommandLine and related classes (in cmdlinetest.h) provide
 *    utilities for constructing command line argument arrays for use in tests
 *    that invoke actual commands.  The same header also provides
 *    gmx::test::CommandLineTestHelper and gmx::test::CommandLineTestBase
 *    for easily creating tests that execute essentially full command-line
 *    programs, including checking the output files produced.
 *  - gmx::test::StringTestBase provides a test fixture for tests that need to
 *    test long strings for correctness.
 *  - gmx::test::StdioTestHelper provides a helper class for tests that need to
 *    execute legacy code where `stdin` reading cannot be easily mocked.
 *
 * Additionally, testinit.h and mpi-printer.h, and their corresponding source
 * files, provide functionality that is not visible on the API level: they
 * provide initialization routines for the above functionality, which are
 * automatically called by the %main() function provided in unittest_main.cpp.
 *
 * mpi-printer.h provides a Google Test listener that is installed when the
 * tests are compiled with MPI.  This listener allows the test binary to be run
 * on multiple MPI ranks, and synchronizes the execution and output from the
 * test cases, as well as makes the test fail on even if an assertion fails
 * only on one rank.
