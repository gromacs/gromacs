/*! \internal \brief Class for building a command-line-style argv
 * array to pass to a GROMACS tool.
 *
 * This class implements the Visitor pattern by inheriting the
 * gmx::OptionsVisitor interface. This means it can traverse a
 * gmx::Options data structure and build an argv array from the
 * options that have been set to real values, while ignoring the
 * options that are either missing, or defined and not set.
 *
 * It also handles the fact that parse_file_args() used in all the
 * GROMACS legacy tools feels the need to modify argv, and has done so
 * since the original GROMACS CVS commit. (Presumably nobody has any
 * idea whether there's a sound reason for that.) That fact prevents
 * us from calling a GROMACS main() and then freeing memory in the
 * argv we passed. So, we have to keep copies of the pointers that
 * were in argv before they were passed into the main(), so we can
 * free them once main() returns.
 *
 * // TODO think about this
 * //  Any method in this class may throw std::bad_alloc if out of
 * // memory.
