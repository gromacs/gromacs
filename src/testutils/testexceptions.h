/*! \brief
 * Macro for throwing a TestException that wraps another exception.
 *
 * \param[in] e    Exception object to wrap.
 *
 * This macro is intended for wrapping exceptions thrown by Gromacs methods
 * that are called from a test for the test's internal purposes.  It wraps the
 * exception in a TestException to make it possible to tell from the type of
 * the exception whether the exception was thrown by the code under test, or by
 * the test code itself.
 *
 * \p e should evaluate to an instance of an object derived from
 * GromacsException.
 *
 * Typical usage in test code:
 * \code
try
{
    // some code that may throw a GromacsException
}
catch (const GromacsException &ex)
{
    GMX_THROW_WRAPPER_TESTEXCEPTION(ex);
}
 * \endcode
