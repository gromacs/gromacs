/*! \brief Declares that this test is an MPI-enabled unit test and
 * expresses the conditions under which it can run.
 *
 * To write unit tests that run under MPI, you need to do a few things:
 *  - Put GMX_MPI_TEST(RankRequirement) as the first statement in your
 *    test body and either declare or use a suitable class as its
 *    argument to express what requirements exist on the number of MPI
 *    ranks for this test.
 *  - Declare your unit test in CMake with gmx_add_mpi_unit_test().
 *    Note that all tests in the binary should fulfill the conditions above.
 *
 * When you do the above, the following will happen:
 *  - The test will get compiled only if thread-MPI or real MPI is enabled.
 *  - The test will get executed only when the specified condition on
 *    the the number of ranks is satisfied.
 *  - If you are using real MPI, the whole test binary is run under
 *    MPI and test execution across the processes is synchronized
 *    (GMX_MPI_TEST() actually has no effect in this case, the
 *    synchronization is handled at a higher level).
 *  - If you are using thread-MPI, GMX_MPI_TEST() is required and it
 *    initializes thread-MPI with the specified number of threads and
 *    runs the rest of the test on each of the threads.
 *
 * \param[in] RankRequirement Class that expresses the necessary
 *     conditions on the number of MPI ranks for the test to continue.
 *     If run with unsupported number of ranks, the remainder of the
 *     test body is skipped, and the GTEST_SKIP() mechanism used to
 *     report the reason why the number of MPI ranks is unsuitable.
 *
 * The RankRequirement class must have two static members; a static
 * method \c bool conditionSatisfied(const int) that can be passed the
 * number of ranks present at run time and return whether the test can
 * run with that number of ranks, and a static const string \c
 * s_skipReason describing the reason why the test cannot be run, when
 * that is the case.
 *
 * You need to be extra careful for variables in the test fixture, if you use
 * one: when run under thread-MPI, these will be shared across all the ranks,
 * while under real MPI, these are naturally different for each process.
 * Local variables in the test body are private to each rank in both cases.
 *
 * Currently, it is not possible to require the use of a single MPI
 * rank, because that will lead to problems with (at least)
 * thread-MPI, but such tests can be written as serial tests anyway.
