/*! \libinternal \file
 * \brief
 * Extra assertions for unit tests.
 *
 * This file provides assert macros to replace (ASSERT|EXPECT)(_NO)?_THROW
 * from Google Test.  They behave otherwise the same as the Google Test ones,
 * but also print details of any unexpected exceptions.  This makes it much
 * easier to see at one glance what went wrong.
 *
 * This file also provides extra floating-point assertions.
 *
 * \if internal
 * \todo
 * The implementation is somewhat ugly, and accesses some Google Test
 * internals.  Could be nice to clean it up a bit.
