 * Functions for constructing file names for test files.
 *
 * Functions getTestFilePath() and getTestDataPath() provide means to access
 * data files that are located in the test source directory.  This is typically
 * used to provide input files for the tests.
 *
 * For temporary files used within a single test (typically in testing code
 * that writes into files), gmx::test::TestTemporaryFileManager is provided.
