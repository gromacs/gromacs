/*! \libinternal \brief
 * Macro to add additional command-line options for the test binary.
 *
 * \param  name    Unique name for the set of options.
 * \param  options Placeholder name for an gmx::Options object for adding options.
 *
 * The macro should be followed by a block that adds the desired command-line
 * options to `options` using gmx::Options::addOption().  \ref module_options
 * provides an overview of the options machinery.
 *
 * `name` must be unique within the executable to which the options are added.
 * If the macro is within an unnamed namespace, then it is sufficient that it
 * is unique within the file.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 * \code
   #include "gromacs/options/basicoptions.h"
   #include "gromacs/options/options.h"
   #include "testutils/testoptions.h"

   namespace gmx
   {
   namespace
   {

   bool g_optionValue = false;

   //! \cond
   GMX_TEST_OPTIONS(MyTestOptions, options)
   {
       options->addOption(BooleanOption("flag").store(&g_optionValue)
                              .description("My description"));
   }
   //! \endcond

   } // namespace
   } // namespace gmx
   \endcode
 *
 * \c \\cond and \c \\endcond statements are necessary around the macro to avoid
 * Doxygen warnings.
 *
 * One macro invocation per an added option, with more of the implementation
 * details hidden inside the macro, could be nicer.  But that requires more
 * elaborate macro machinery, so it is probably not worth the effort and
 * complexity.
