        "non-bonded pair kernels. The non-bonded pair kernels are",
        "the most compute intensive part of MD simulations",
        "and usually comprise 60 to 90 percent of the runtime.",
        "For this reason they are highly optimized and several different",
        "setups are available to compute the same physical interactions.",
        "In addition, there are different physical treatments of Coulomb",
        "interactions and optimizations for atoms without Lennard-Jones",
        "interactions. There are also different physical treatments of",
        "Lennard-Jones interactions, but only a plain cut-off is supported",
        "in this tool, as that is by far the most common treatment.",
        "And finally, while force output is always necessary, energy output",
        "is only required at certain steps. In total there are",
        "12 relevant combinations of options. The combinations double to 24",
        "when two different SIMD setups are supported. These combinations",
        "can be run with a single invocation using the [TT]-all[tt] option.",
        "The behavior of each kernel is affected by caching behavior,",
        "which is determined by the hardware used together with the system size",
        "and the cut-off radius. The larger the number of atoms per thread,",
        "the more L1 cache is needed to avoid L1 cache misses.",
        "The cut-off radius mainly affects the data reuse: a larger cut-off",
        "results in more data reuse and makes the kernel less sensitive to cache",
        "misses.[PAR]",
        "OpenMP parallelization is used to utilize multiple hardware threads",
        "within a compute node. In these benchmarks there is no interaction",
        "between threads, apart from starting and closing a single OpenMP",
        "parallel region per iteration. Additionally, threads interact",
        "through sharing and evicting data from shared caches.",
        "The number of threads to use is set with the [TT]-nt[tt] option.",
        "Thread affinity is important, especially with SMT and shared",
        "caches. Affinities can be set through the OpenMP library using",
        "the GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY environment variable.[PAR]",
        "The benchmark tool times one or more kernels by running them",
        "repeatedly for a number of iterations set by the [TT]-iter[tt]",
        "option. An initial kernel call is done to avoid additional initial",
        "cache misses. Times are recording in cycles read from efficient,",
        "high accuracy counters in the CPU. Note that these often do not",
        "correspond to actual clock cycles. For each kernel, the tool",
        "reports the total number of cycles, cycles per iteration,",
        "and (total and useful) pair interactions per cycle.",
        "Because a cluster pair list is used instead of an atom pair list,",
        "interactions are also computed for some atom pairs that are beyond",
        "the cut-off distance. These pairs are not useful (except for",
        "additional buffering, but that is not of interest here),",
        "only a side effect of the cluster-pair setup. The SIMD 2xMM kernel",
        "has a higher useful pair ratio then the 4xM kernel due to a smaller",
        "cluster size, but a lower total pair throughput.",
        "It is best to run this, or for that matter any, benchmark",
        "with locked CPU clocks, as thermal throttling can significantly",
        "affect performance. If that is not an option, the [TT]-warmup[TT]",
        "option can be used to run initial, untimed iterations to warm up",
        "the processor.[PAR]",
        "The most relevant regime is between 0.1 to 1 millisecond per",
        "iteration. Thus it is useful to run with system sizes that cover",
        "both ends of this regime.[PAR]",
        "The [TT]-simd[tt] and [TT]-table[tt] options select different",
        "implementations to compute the same physics. The choice of these",
        "options should ideally be optimized for the target hardware.",
        "Historically, we only found tabulated Ewald correction to be useful",
        "on 2-wide SIMD or 4-wide SIMD without FMA support. As all modern",
        "architectures are wider and support FMA, we do not use tables by",
        "default. The only exceptions are kernels without SIMD, which only",
        "support tables.",
        "Options [TT]-coulomb[tt], [TT]-combrule[tt] and [TT]-halflj[tt]",

        "use Lennard-Jones on hydrogen atoms in most water models.",
        "In the MD engine, any clusters where at most half of the atoms",
        "have LJ interactions will automatically use this kernel.",
