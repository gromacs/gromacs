DESCRIPTION

[THISMODULE] is the main computational chemistry engine within GROMACS.
Obviously, it performs Molecular Dynamics simulations, but it can also perform
Stochastic Dynamics, Energy Minimization, test particle insertion or
(re)calculation of energies. Normal mode analysis is another option. In this
case mdrun builds a Hessian matrix from single conformation. For usual Normal
Modes-like calculations, make sure that the structure provided is properly
energy-minimized. The generated matrix can be diagonalized by [gmx-nmeig].

The mdrun program reads the run input file (-s) and distributes the topology
over ranks if needed. mdrun produces at least four output files. A single log
file (-g) is written. The trajectory file (-o), contains coordinates,
velocities and optionally forces. The structure file (-c) contains the
coordinates and velocities of the last step. The energy file (-e) contains
energies, the temperature, pressure, etc, a lot of these things are also
printed in the log file. Optionally coordinates can be written to a compressed
trajectory file (-x).

The option -dhdl is only used when free energy calculation is turned on.

Running mdrun efficiently in parallel is a complex topic, many aspects of
which are covered in the online User Guide. You should look there for
practical advice on using many of the options available in mdrun.

ED (essential dynamics) sampling and/or additional flooding potentials are
switched on by using the -ei flag followed by an .edi file. The .edi file can
be produced with the make_edi tool or by using options in the essdyn menu of
the WHAT IF program. mdrun produces a .xvg output file that contains
projections of positions, velocities and forces onto selected eigenvectors.

When user-defined potential functions have been selected in the .mdp file the
-table option is used to pass mdrun a formatted table with potential
functions. The file is read from either the current directory or from the
GMXLIB directory. A number of pre-formatted tables are presented in the GMXLIB
dir, for 6-8, 6-9, 6-10, 6-11, 6-12 Lennard-Jones potentials with normal
Coulomb. When pair interactions are present, a separate table for pair
interaction functions is read using the -tablep option.

When tabulated bonded functions are present in the topology, interaction
functions are read using the -tableb option. For each different tabulated
interaction type used, a table file name must be given. For the topology to
work, a file name given here must match a character sequence before the file
extension. That sequence is: an underscore, then a 'b' for bonds, an 'a' for
angles or a 'd' for dihedrals, and finally the matching table number index
used in the topology. Note that, these options are deprecated, and in future
will be available via grompp.

The options -px and -pf are used for writing pull COM coordinates and forces
when pulling is selected in the .mdp file.

The option -membed does what used to be g_membed, i.e. embed a protein into a
membrane. This module requires a number of settings that are provided in a
data file that is the argument of this option. For more details in membrane
embedding, see the documentation in the user guide. The options -mn and -mp
are used to provide the index and topology files used for the embedding.

The option -pforce is useful when you suspect a simulation crashes due to too
large forces. With this option coordinates and forces of atoms with a force
larger than a certain value will be printed to stderr. It will also terminate
the run when non-finite forces are present.

Checkpoints containing the complete state of the system are written at regular
intervals (option -cpt) to the file -cpo, unless option -cpt is set to -1. The
previous checkpoint is backed up to state_prev.cpt to make sure that a recent
state of the system is always available, even when the simulation is
terminated while writing a checkpoint. With -cpnum all checkpoint files are
kept and appended with the step number. A simulation can be continued by
reading the full state from file with option -cpi. This option is intelligent
in the way that if no checkpoint file is found, GROMACS just assumes a normal
run and starts from the first step of the .tpr file. By default the output
will be appending to the existing output files. The checkpoint file contains
checksums of all output files, such that you will never loose data when some
output files are modified, corrupt or removed. There are three scenarios with
-cpi:

* no files with matching names are present: new output files are written

* all files are present with names and checksums matching those stored in the
checkpoint file: files are appended

* otherwise no files are modified and a fatal error is generated

With -noappend new output files are opened and the simulation part number is
added to all output file names. Note that in all cases the checkpoint file
itself is not renamed and will be overwritten, unless its name does not match
the -cpo option.

With checkpointing the output is appended to previously written output files,
unless -noappend is used or none of the previous output files are present
(except for the checkpoint file). The integrity of the files to be appended is
verified using checksums which are stored in the checkpoint file. This ensures
that output can not be mixed up or corrupted due to file appending. When only
some of the previous output files are present, a fatal error is generated and
no old output files are modified and no new output files are opened. The
result with appending will be the same as from a single run. The contents will
be binary identical, unless you use a different number of ranks or dynamic
load balancing or the FFT library uses optimizations through timing.

With option -maxh a simulation is terminated and a checkpoint file is written
at the first neighbor search step where the run time exceeds -maxh*0.99 hours.
This option is particularly useful in combination with setting nsteps to -1
either in the mdp or using the similarly named command line option (although
the latter is deprecated). This results in an infinite run, terminated only
when the time limit set by -maxh is reached (if any) or upon receiving a
signal.

Interactive molecular dynamics (IMD) can be activated by using at least one of
the three IMD switches: The -imdterm switch allows one to terminate the
simulation from the molecular viewer (e.g. VMD). With -imdwait, mdrun pauses
whenever no IMD client is connected. Pulling from the IMD remote can be turned
on by -imdpull. The port mdrun listens to can be altered by -imdport.The file
pointed to by -if contains atom indices and forces if IMD pulling is used.
