 * \brief Helper object for running grompp and mdrun in
 * integration tests of mdrun functionality
 *
 * Objects of this class are intended to be owned by
 * IntegrationTestFixture objects, and an IntegrationTestFixture
 * object might own more than one SimulationRunner.
 *
 * The setup phase creates various temporary files for input and
 * output that are common for mdrun tests, using the file manager
 * object of the fixture that owns this object. Individual tests
 * should create any extra filenames similarly, so that the test
 * users's current working directory does not get littered with files
 * left over from tests.
 *
 * Any method in this class may throw std::bad_alloc if out of memory.
 *
 * By default, the convenience methods callGrompp() and callMdrun()
 * just prepare and run a default call to mdrun. If there is a need to
 * customize the command-line for grompp or mdrun (e.g. to invoke
 * -maxwarn n, or -reprod), then make a CommandLine object with the
 * appropriate flags and pass that into the routines that accept such.

/*! \internal
 * \brief Declares test fixture base class for
 * integration tests of mdrun functionality
 *
 * Derived fixture classes (or individual test cases) that might have
 * specific requirements should assert that behaviour, rather than
 * hard-code the requirements. A test that (for example) can't run
 * with more than one thread should report that as a diagnostic, so the
 * person running the test (or designing the test harness) can get
 * feedback on what tests need what conditions without having to read
 * the code of lots of tests.
 *
 * Specifying the execution context (such as numbers of threads and
 * processors) is normally sensible to specify from the test harness
 * (i.e. when CMake/CTest/the user runs a test executable), because
 * only there is information about the hardware available. The default
 * values for such context provided in test fixtures for mdrun should
 * mirror the defaults for mdrun, but currently mdrun.c hard-codes
 * those in a gmx_hw_opt_t.

 * Any method in this class may throw std::bad_alloc if out of memory.
