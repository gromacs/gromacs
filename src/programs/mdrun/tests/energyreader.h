 * \brief Interfaces of related classes for tests that want to
 * inspect energies produced by mdrun.
 *
 * The responsibilities for reading and sharing information from .edr
 * files in an exception-safe manner are shared between two
 * classes. Intended usage is to call openEnergyFileToReadFields() to
 * return an EnergyFrameReader that knows it expects to read the named
 * .edr fields from each frame. Successive calls to its
 * EnergyFrameReader::readNextFrame() and EnergyFrameReader::frame()
 * methods will return EnergyFrame objects that contain the values for
 * the .edr fields registered earlier.
