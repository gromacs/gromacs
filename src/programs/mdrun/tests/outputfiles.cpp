/*! \brief Test fixture base for presence of output files
 *
 * This test checks that some expected output files are actually written
 * in a very simple mdrun call. Currently, it tests for the presence of
 * full precision trajectory (.trr), log file (.log), energy trajectory (.edr),
 * final configuration (.gro) and checkpoint file (.cpt).
 *
 * The test only checks whether the files are existing, it does not check
 * their contents.
