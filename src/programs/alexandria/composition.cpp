/*! \defgroup module_alexandria Processing of input files and force fields
 * \ingroup group_preprocessing
 * \brief
 * Provides tools for input processing based on the alexandria force field
 *
 * The tools in the alexandria directory are under heavy development still.
 * Once finished they will provide processing of small molecules files based
 * on quantum chemistry or other input source through the OpenBabel library.
 * Assigning of atom types, derivation of charges, and generation of
 * molecular topology files (or objects) is implemented.
