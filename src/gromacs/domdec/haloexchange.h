 * \brief Declares the HaloExchange class for halo communication of coordinates and forces
 *
 * The algorithm this class implements uses direct communication between the home domain
 * and all domains in the, up to 7, zones. This contrasts with the original eighth shell
 * domain decomposition which only communicated with neighbor domains along the three
 * dimensions and aggregrated data over multiple pulses to communicate with more distant
 * domains. This is also referred to as staged communication. The setup here can be
 * referred to as "direct" instead, not to be confused with "GPU direct"
 * communication.
 *
 * The HaloExchange class contains a list of DomainPairComm objects, one for every domain
 * in the halo. The communication setup and calls for each domain pair are completely
 * independent from the other pairs. This make the class setup simple and also allows
 * for overlap of all communication for the different domains. The only coupling between
 * DomainPairComm objects is that they together should provide the atoms necessary
 * to compute all required non-bonded and bonded interactions in the system.
