 * Halo communication for the force calculation.
 *
 * This file contains functions to set up the halo communication
 * for the eighth shell domain decomposition and to execute
 * the halo communication.
 * Only nearest neighbor communication is supported, which means that
 * each rank/domain sends and receives from 1, 3 and 7 ranks with 1D, 2D
 * and 3D decomposition respectively. All communication is non-blocking.
