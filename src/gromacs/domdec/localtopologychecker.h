 * \brief Has responsibility for checking that the local topology distributed
 * across domains describes a total number of bonded interactions that matches
 * the system topology
 *
 * This uses the ObservablesReducer framework to check that the count
 * of bonded interactions in the local topology made for each domain
 * sums to the expected value. Because this check is not urgent, the
 * communication that it requires is done at the next opportunity,
 * rather than requiring extra communication. If the check fails, a
 * fatal error stops execution. In principle, if there was a bug,
 * GROMACS might crash in the meantime because of the wrong
 * forces. However as a bug is unlikely we optimize by avoiding
 * creating extra overhead from communication.
