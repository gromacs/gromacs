/*! \brief Returns whether to use a direct list only
 *
 * There are two methods implemented for finding the local atom number
 * belonging to a global atom number:
 * 1) a simple, direct array
 * 2) a hash table consisting of list of linked lists indexed with
 *    the global number modulo mod.
 * Memory requirements:
 * 1) numAtomsTotal*2 ints
 * 2) numAtomsLocal*(2+1-2(1-e^-1/2))*4 ints
 * where numAtomsLocal is the number of atoms in the home + communicated zones.
 * Method 1 is faster for low parallelization, 2 for high parallelization.
 * We switch to method 2 when it uses less than half the memory method 1.
