/*! \brief Partial least squares (PLS) regression
 *
 * Implemented as described in:
 *
 * Denham, M. C. "Implementing Partial Least Squares."
 * Statistics and Computing 5, no. 3 (September 1995): 191â€“202. doi:10.1007/BF00142661.
 *
 * The algoritm aims to find a vector t to minimize
 *
 * abs(y-X*t)
 *
 * where the vector t=w*q is a linear combination of vectors.
 *
 * \param x  contains the centered (ln,k)-matrix X.
 * \param y  contains the centered (n)-vector y.
 * \param n  the number of "relevant" rows of the matrix X.
 * \param ln the "real" number of rows in the matrix x, or the "leading dimension"
 *           in FORTRAN terms. If all structure-value pairs are used for training, this number
 *           is equal to n, otherwise bigger.
 * \param k  the number of columns (to be used) of the matrix x.
 * \param a  < MIN(n-1,k) - the number of PLS factors to include in the regression
 *           of y on the matrix X.
 * \param w  (output) a (k,a)-matrix containing the coefficient vectors stored by column of
 *           the a PLS regression factors obtained from the matrix X on .
 * \param q  a (a)-vector containing the least squares regression coefficients of
 *           the ordinary least squares regression of y on the PLS factor matrix t.
 *
 * Arrays entered into this function should be in FORTRAN-compatible
 * column major order. This is
