/** Calculate eigenvalues/vectors a matrix stored in linear memory (not sparse).
 *
 *  This routine uses lapack to diagonalize a matrix efficiently, and
 *  the eigenvalues/vectors will be sorted in ascending order on output.
 *  Gromacs comes with a built-in portable BLAS/LAPACK, but if performance
 *  matters it is advisable to link with an optimized vendor-provided library.
 *
 *  \param a            Pointer to matrix data, total size n*n
 *                      The input data in the matrix will be destroyed/changed.
 *  \param n            Side of the matrix to calculate eigenvalues for.
 *  \param index_lower  Index of first eigenvector to determine.
 *  \param index_upper  Last eigenvector determined is index_upper-1.
 *  \param eigenvalues  Array of the eigenvalues on return. The length
 *                      of this array _must_ be n, even if not all
 *                      eigenvectors are calculated, since all eigenvalues
 *                      might be needed as an intermediate step.
 *  \param eigenvec     If this pointer is non-NULL, the eigenvectors
 *                      specified by the indices are returned as rows of
 *                      a matrix, i.e. eigenvector j starts at offset j*n, and
 *                      is of length n.
