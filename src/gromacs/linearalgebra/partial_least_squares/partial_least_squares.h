/*! \brief Partial least squares (PLS) regression
 *
 * Implemented as described in:
 *
 * Denham, M. C. "Implementing Partial Least Squares."
 * Statistics and Computing 5, no. 3 (September 1995): 191â€“202. doi:10.1007/BF00142661.
 *
 * The algoritm aims to find a vector t to minimize
 *
 * abs(y-X*t)
 *
 * where the vector t=w*q is a linear combination of vectors.
 *
 * \param [in]  X  contains the centered (n,p)-matrix X.
 * \param [in]  y  contains the centered (n)-vector y.
 * \param [in]  n  the number of rows of the matrix X to use in analysis.
 * \param [in]  p  the number of columns of the matrix X to use in analysis.
 * \param [in]  k  the number of PLS factors to include in the regression of y on the matrix X.
 * \param [out] W  a (k,p)-matrix containing the coefficient vectors stored by column of
 *                 the a PLS regression factors obtained from the matrix X.
 * \param [out] q  a (k)-vector containing the least squares regression coefficients of
 *                 the ordinary least squares regression of y on the PLS factor matrix t.
