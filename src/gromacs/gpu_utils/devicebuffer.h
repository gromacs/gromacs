/*! \brief
 *  Reallocates the device-side buffer.
 *
 *  Reallocates the device-side memory pointed by \p buffer.
 *  Allocation is buffered and therefore freeing is only needed
 *  if the previously allocated space is not enough.
 *  \p currentNumValues and \p currentMaxNumValues are updated.
 *  TODO: \p currentNumValues, \p currentMaxNumValues, \p deviceContext
 *  should all be encapsulated in a host-side class together with the buffer.
 *
 *  \tparam        ValueType            Raw value type of the \p buffer.
 *  \param[in,out] buffer               Pointer to the device-side buffer
 *  \param[in]     numValues            Number of values to accommodate.
 *  \param[in,out] currentNumValues     The pointer to the buffer's number of values.
 *  \param[in,out] currentMaxNumValues  The pointer to the buffer's capacity.
 *  \param[in]     deviceContext        The buffer's device context.
