 *
 * For an efficient non-blocking transfer (e.g. to a GPU), the memory
 * pages for a buffer need to be pinned to a physical page. Aligning
 * such buffers to a physical page should miminize the number of pages
 * that need to be pinned. However, some buffers that may be used for
 * such transfers may also be used in either GROMACS builds or run
 * paths that cannot use such a device, so the policy can be
 * configured so that the resource consumption is no higher than
 * required for correct, efficient operation in all cases. */

 * \brief Policy class for configuring gmx::Allocator, to manage
 * allocations of memory that may be needed for e.g. GPU transfers.
 *
 * This allocator has state, so is most useful in cases where it is
 * not known at compile time whether the allocated memory will be
 * transferred to some device. It will increase the size of containers
 * that use it. If the GROMACS build is configured with CUDA support,
 * then memory will be allocated with PageAlignedAllocator, and that
 * page pinned to physical memory if the pinning mode has been
 * activated. If pinning mode is deactivated, or the GROMACS build
 * does not support CUDA, then the memory will be allocated with
 * AlignedAllocator. The pin() and unpin() methods work with the CUDA
 * build, and silently do nothing otherwise. In future, we may modify
 * or generalize this to work differently in other cases.
 *
 * The intended use is to configure gmx::Allocator with this class as
 * its policy class, and then to use e.g.
 * std::vector::get_allocator().getPolicy() to control whether the
 * allocation policy should activate its pinning mode. The policy
 * object can also be used to explicitly pin() and unpin() the buffer
 * when it is using PinningPolicy::PinnedIfSupported. The policy object is
 * returned by value (as required by the C++ standard for
 * get_allocator(), which copies a std::shared_ptr, so the policy
 * object should be retrieved sparingly, e.g. only upon resize of the
 * allocation. (Normal operation of the vector, e.g. during resize,
 * incurs only the cost of the pointer indirection needed to consult
 * the current state of the allocation policy.)
 *
 * \todo As a minor optimization, consider also having a stateless
 * version of this policy, which might be slightly faster or more
 * convenient to use in the cases where it is known at compile time
 * that the allocation will be used to transfer to a GPU.
