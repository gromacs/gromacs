/*! \libinternal \brief
 * A class which allows for CPU thread to mark and wait for certain GPU stream execution point.
 *
 * The event can be put into the stream with \ref GpuEventSynchronizer::markEvent and then later
 * waited on with \ref GpuEventSynchronizer::waitForEvent or
 * \ref GpuEventSynchronizer::enqueueWaitEvent.
 *
 * Additionally, this class offers facilities for runtime checking of correctness by counting
 * how many times each marked event is used as a synchronization point.
 *
 * - When the class is constructed, a required minimal (\c minConsumptionCount) and maximal (\c maxConsumptionCount) number of
 * consumptions can be specified. By default, both are set to 1.
 * - The event is considered <em>fully consumed</em> if its current number of consumptions \c c equals
 * \c maxConsumptionCount.
 * - The event is considered <em>sufficiently consumed</em> if <tt>minConsumptionCount <= c <= maxConsumptionCount</tt>.
 * - The class is initialized in the <em>fully consumed</em> state, so it can not be consumed right away.
 * - Consuming the event is only possible if it is not <em>fully consumed</em> (<tt>c < maxConsumptionCount</tt>).
 * Consuming the event increments \c c by 1. Trying to consume <em>fully consumed</em> event
 * throws \ref gmx::InternalError.
 * - \ref GpuEventSynchronizer::reset returns object into the initial <em>fully consumed</em> state.
 * This function is intended to manually override the consumption limits.
 * - \ref GpuEventSynchronizer::consume \em consumes the event, without doing anything else.
 * This function is intended to manually override the consumption limits.
 * - \ref GpuEventSynchronizer::markEvent enqueues new event into the provided stream, and sets \c to 0.
 * Marking is only possible if the event is <em>sufficiently consumed</em>, otherwise \ref gmx::InternalError
 * is thrown.
 * - \ref GpuEventSynchronizer::waitForEvent \em consumes the event and blocks the host thread until
 * the event is ready (complete).
 * - \ref GpuEventSynchronizer::enqueueWaitEvent \em consumes the event and blocks the inserts
 * a blocking barrier into the provided stream which blocks the execution of all tasks later submitted
 * to this stream until the event is ready (completes).
 *
 * Default <tt>minConsumptionCount=maxConsumptionCount=1</tt> limits mean that each call to
 * \ref GpuEventSynchronizer::markEvent must be followed by exactly one
 * \ref GpuEventSynchronizer::enqueueWaitEvent or \ref GpuEventSynchronizer::enqueueWaitEvent.
 * This is the recommended pattern for most use cases. By providing other constructor arguments,
 * this requirement can be relaxed as needed.
