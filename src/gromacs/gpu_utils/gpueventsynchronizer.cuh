/*! \libinternal \brief
 * A class which allows for CPU thread to mark and wait for certain GPU stream execution point.
 * The event can be put into the stream with markEvent() and then later waited on with waitForEvent().
 * This can be repeated as necessary, but the current implementation does not allow waiting on
 * completed event more than once, expecting only exact pairs of markEvent(stream); waitForEvent().
 * The class generally attempts to track the correctness of its state transitions, but
 * please note that calling waitForEvent() right after the construction will succeed with CUDA but fail with OpenCL.
 *
 * Another possible mode of operation can be implemented if needed:
 * multiple calls to waitForEvent() after a single markEvent().
 * For this, only some small alterations to gpueventsynchronizer_ocl.h need to be made.
 * This was tested to work both with CUDA and NVidia OpenCL, but not with AMD/Intel OpenCL.
