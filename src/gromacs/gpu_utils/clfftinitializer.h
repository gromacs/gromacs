 * \brief
 * Declares ClfftInitializer class, which initializes and
 * tears down the clFFT library resources in OpenCL builds,
 * and does nothing in other builds, and a factory function for it.
 *
 * clFFT itself is used in the OpenCL implementation of PME
 * for 3D R2C/C2R transforms. It is know to work with NVidia
 * OpenCL, AMD fglrx and AMDGPU-PRO drivers, and to not work with
 * AMD Rocm dev preview as of May 2018 (#2515).
 * TODO: find out compatibility with Intel once the rest of PME
 * gets there (#2516), or by building clFFT own tests.

 * \brief Handle clFFT library init and tear down in RAII style also
 * with mutual exclusion.
 *
 * Only one thread per process needs to attempt to set up and tear
 * down the clFFT library, but this wrapper object ensures that it is
 * safe to do so more than once, or from any thread. It is the
 * responsibility of the caller to ensure that no use of the clFFT
 * library is made before making an object of this type, or after the
 * first such object is destroyed. If no more objects remain to be
 * destroyed, then it is safe to create another and resume clFFT work.
 *
 * \todo Consider making a composite object that also handles
 * on-demand compilation, managing lifetime of PME FFT kernel programs
 * to avoid exhausting resources and/or recompiling kernels previously
 * used.  See Redmine #2535.
 *
 * \todo Consider implementing an appropriate flavor of the nifty
 * counter idiom so that both static initialization and
 * deinitialization can work in a fast, leak-free, and thread-safe way
 * without imposing constraints on the calling code.
 * See Redmine #2535. */
