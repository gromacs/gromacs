/*! \brief Compile the specified kernel for the context and device.
 *
 * \param[out] fplog                 Open file pointer for log output
 * \param[in]  kernelBaseFilename    The name of the kernel source file to compile, e.g. "nbnxn_ocl_kernels.cl"
 * \param[in]  extraDefines          Preprocessor defines required by the calling code, e.g. for configuring the kernels
 * \param[in]  context               OpenCL context on the device to compile for
 * \param[in]  deviceId              OpenCL device id of the device to compile for
 * \param[in]  deviceVendorId        Enumerator of the device vendor to compile for
 *
 * \returns The compiled OpenCL program
 *
 * \todo Consider whether we can parallelize the compilation of all
 * the kernels by compiling them in separate programs - but since the
 * resulting programs can't refer to each other, that might lead to
 * bloat of util code?
 *
 * \throws std::bad_alloc  if out of memory.
 *         FileIOError     if a file I/O error prevents returning a valid compiled program.
 *         InternalError   if an OpenCL API error prevents returning a valid compiled program. */
