 *  \brief Implements a GpuEventSynchronizer class for SYCL.
 *
 *  There is no way to do this efficiently within the SYCL standard.
 *  With DPC++, this implementation relies on SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_ENQUEUE_BARRIER extension,
 *  which directly enqueues a CUDA-like barrier event.
 *  With AdaptiveCpp, it relies on ACPP_EXT_ENQUEUE_CUSTOM_OPERATION extension to submit
 *  an empty operation (that can have dependencies and returns an event).
