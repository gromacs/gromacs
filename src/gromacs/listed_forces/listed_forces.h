 * Located here is the code for
 * - computing energies and forces for interactions between a small
     number of particles, e.g bonds, position restraints and listed
     non-bonded interactions (e.g. 1-4).
 * - high-level functions used by mdrun for computing a set of such
     quantities
 * - managing thread-wise decomposition, thread-local buffer output,
     and reduction of output data across threads.
