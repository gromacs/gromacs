   Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

   This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321, whose
   text is available at
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt
   The code is derived from the text of the RFC, including the test suite
   (section A.5) but excluding the rest of Appendix A.  It does not include
   any code or documentation that is identified in the RFC as being
   copyrighted.

   The original and principal author of md5.h is L. Peter Deutsch
   <ghost@aladdin.com>.  Other authors are noted in the change history
   that follows (in reverse chronological order):

   2002-04-13 lpd Removed support for non-ANSI compilers; removed
    references to Ghostscript; clarified derivation from RFC 1321;
    now handles byte order either statically or dynamically.
   1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
   1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5);
    added conditionalization for C++ compilation from Martin
    Purschke <purschke@bnl.gov>.
   1999-05-03 lpd Original version.
