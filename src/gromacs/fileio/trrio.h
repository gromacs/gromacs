/**************************************************************
 *
 * These routines handle trr (trajectory) I/O, they read and
 * write trr files. The routines should be able to read single
 * and double precision files without the user noting it.
 * The files are backward compatible, therefore the header holds
 * some unused variables.
 *
 * The routines in the corresponding c-file trrio.cpp
 * are based on the lower level routines in gmxfio.cpp
 * The file handle returned from gmx_trr_open()
 * can also be used with the routines in gmxfio.h
 *
 * Note that TRR was designed to represent a step number as a default
 * integer, which depends on the implementation, but is typically and
 * 32 bit. We didn't design the format to be extensible, so we can't
 * fix the fact that after 2^31 frames, step numbers will wrap to be
 * negative. Fortunately, this tends not to cause serious problems,
 * and we've fixed it in TNG. Meanwhile, the implementation pretends
 * to the rest of GROMACS that it functions with int64_t like all
 * other step numbers, but the actual range in practice depends on the
 * defaults of the implementation in use now (or when the file was
 * written).
