/*! \brief
 * Handles interaction of file name options with global options.
 *
 * Currently, this class implements support for a global default file name
 * that overrides any option-specific default.
 *
 * \todo
 * Currently, this class has very little logic, and just provides the global
 * values to FileNameOptionStorage implementation.  A cleaner design would have
 * most of the non-trivial file name completion logic in this class, so that
 * the customizations would be centralized here.
 *
 * Creating a FileNameOptionManager for an Options object is optional, even if
 * the Options contains FileNameOption options.  Features from the manager are
 * not available if the manager is not created, but otherwise the options work.
