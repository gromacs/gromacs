 * Base class for option managers.

 * Options::addManager().  It doesn't provide any methods, but only supports
 * transporting these classes through the Options collection into the
 * individual option implementation classes.
 *
 * The virtual destructor is present to make this class polymorphic, such that
 * `dynamic_cast` can be used when retrieving a manager of a certain type for
 * the individual options.

 *
 * In order to keep the public interface of this class simple, functionality
 * to assign values to options is provided by a separate OptionsAssigner class.
 * Similarly, functionality for looping over all options (e.g., for writing out
 * help) is provided by OptionsIterator.

         *
         * Option managers are used by some types of options that require
         * interaction between different option instances (e.g., selection
         * options), or need to support globally set properties (e.g., a global
         * default file prefix).  Option objects can retrieve the pointer to
         * their manager when they are created, and the caller can alter the
         * behavior of the options through the manager.
         * See the individual managers for details.
         *
         * Caller is responsible for memory management of \p manager.
         * The Options object (and its contained options) only stores a
         * reference to the object.
