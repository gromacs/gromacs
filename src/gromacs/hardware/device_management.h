 * But "CU" is only vaguely defined by the standard, and on different vendors the same
 * API call returns different things.

 * On NVIDIA, that is the number of SMs.
 *
 * On AMD, that is the number of Compute Units, which are similar to CUDA's SM.
 * Except on RDNA, where the number of Dual Compute Units is returned (https://stackoverflow.com/a/63976796/929437).
 *
 * On Intel, that is the number of EUs (XVEs), which are similar to CUDA core. The concept similar
 * to CUDA SM is called sub-slice (Xe Core, XC), and it contains 16 EUs (Gen9-Gen11, Xe).
 *
 * This function uses CUDA SM as a reference. To get the number of SM-like units on a device,
 * divide the result of \c CL_DEVICE_MAX_COMPUTE_UNITS / \c info::device::max_compute_units API
 * call by the value returned by this function.
