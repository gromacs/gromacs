/*! \libinternal \file
 * \brief
 * Declares the reset handler class.
 *
 * This class resets the various counters based on either the time (master rank sends
 * checkpointing signal after 49.5% or run time), or based on the number of elapsed
 * steps (handled locally by all ranks independently). Resets can happen in different
 * ways:
 *
 *     * at a predetermined step (gmx mdrun -resetstep XXX)
 *     * at half of the number of steps (gmx mdrun -resethway and nsteps set)
 *     * at half of the max wall time (gmx mdrun -resethway -maxh XX), which is
 *       implemented triggered when walltime >= 49.5% of max
 *
 * If two or more of these reset conditions are set, the first condition which is met
 * resets the counters, there is no second reset happening. Note also that
 * -resethway with nsteps set overwrites -resetstep
 * (gmx mdrun -resethway -nsteps 100000 -resetstep 1000 will result in a reset at step
 * 50000, not 1000).
 *
 * The setting and handling is implemented in private functions. They are only called
 * if a respective boolean is true. For the trivial case of no reset needed (or no reset
 * signal setting on any other rank than master), the translation unit of the calling
 * function is therefore never left. The current implementation also allows the handler
 * and setters to be ignored once a reset has been done, as a reset is only allowed to
 * happen once. In the future, many of these cases this will be achieved by adding
 * (or not adding) handlers / setters to the task graph.
