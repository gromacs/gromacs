 * \brief This file defines functions for inter- and intra-simulation
 * signalling by mdrun.
 *
 * This handles details of responding to termination conditions,
 * coordinating checkpoints, and coordinating multi-simulations.
 *
 * \todo Move this to mdrunutility module alongside gathering
 * multi-simulation communication infrastructure there.
