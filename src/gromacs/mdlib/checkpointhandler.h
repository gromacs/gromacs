/*! \libinternal \file
 * \brief
 * Declares the checkpoint handler class.
 *
 * This class sets the signal to checkpoint based on the elapsed simulation time,
 * and handles the signal if it is received. When handling the signal (via
 * decideIfCheckpointingThisStep()), it is deciding whether a checkpoint should be saved
 * at the current step. This can be due to a received signal, or if the current simulation
 * step is the last. This information can be queried via the isCheckpointingStep() function.
 *
 * The setting and handling is implemented in private functions. They are only called
 * if a respective boolean is true. For the trivial case of no checkpointing (or no checkpoint
 * signal setting on any other rank than master), the translation unit of the calling
 * function is therefore never left. In the future, this will be achieved by adding
 * (or not adding) handlers / setters to the task graph.
