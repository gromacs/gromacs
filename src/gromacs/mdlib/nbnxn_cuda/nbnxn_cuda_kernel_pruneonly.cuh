/*! \brief Compute capability dependent definition of kernel launch configuration parameters.
 *
 * Kernel launch bounds for different compute capabilities. The value of NTHREAD_Z
 * represents the j-concurrency, hence it determines the number of threads per block.
 * It is chosen such that 100% occupancy is maintained (on Maxwell and later for any NTHREAD_Z,
 * requires >=4 warp/block, NTHREAD_Z>=2 on Kepler).
 *
 * Hence, values NTHREAD_Z >= 2 trade inter- for intra-block parallelism
 * which has the advantage of lowering the overhead of starting up a block, filling shmem
 * and registers, etc. Ideally we'd want to expose as much intra-block work as possible
 * As we also split lists to cater for the block-parallelization needed by the register-
 * limited non-bonded kernels, for very short j-loops large NTHREAD_Z will cause slowdown
 * as it leads to intra-block warp imbalance. Ideally, we'd want to auto-tune the choice
 * of NTHREAD_Z, but for now we instead pick a reasonable tradeoff-value.
 *
 * Note that given the above input size tradeoffs and that performance depends on
 * additional factors including GPU arch, #SM's, we'll accept performance tradeoffs
 * of using a fixed NTHREAD_Z=4. The following outliers have been observed:
 *   - up to 25% faster (rolling) prune kernels with NTHREAD_Z=8 in the regime where lists
 *     are not split (much), but the rolling chunks are small;
 *   - with large inputs NTHREAD_Z=1 is 2-3% faster (on CC>=5.0)

/*! \brief Nonbonded list pruning kernel.
 *
 *  The \p haveFreshList template parameter defines the two flavors of the kernel; when
 *  true a new list from immediately after pair-list generation is pruned using rlistOuter,
 *  the pruned masks are stored in a separate buffer and the outer-list is pruned
 *  using the rlistInner distance; when false only the pruning with rlistInner is performed.
 *
 *  Kernel launch parameters:
 *   - #blocks   = #pair lists, blockId = pair list Id
 *   - #threads  = NTHREAD_Z * c_clSize^2
 *   - shmem     = see nbnxn_cuda.cu:calc_shmem_required_prune()
 *
 *   Each thread calculates an i-j atom distance..
