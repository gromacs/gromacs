 * \brief SETTLE tests runners.
 *
 * Declares test runner class for SETTLE algorithm. The test runners abstract
 * class is used to unify the interfaces for CPU and GPU implementations of the
 * SETTLE algorithm. This allows to run the same test on the same data using
 * different implementations of the parent class, that inherit its interfaces.
