 * \brief Leap-Frog tests runners.
 *
 * Declares test runner class for Leap-Frog algorithm. The test runners abstract
 * class is used to unify the interfaces for CPU and GPU implementations of the
 * Leap-Frog algorithm. This allows to run the same test on the same data using
 * different implementations of the parent class, that inherit its interfaces.
