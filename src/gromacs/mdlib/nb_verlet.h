/*! \libinternal \defgroup __module_nb_verlet Short-range non-bonded interaction module
 * \ingroup group_mdrun
 *
 * \brief Computes forces and energies for short-range pair-interactions
 * based on the Verlet algorithm. The algorithm uses pair-lists generated
 * at fixed intervals as well as various flavors of pair interaction kernels
 * implemented for a wide range of CPU and GPU architectures.
 *
 * The module includes support for flavors of Coulomb and Lennard-Jones interaction
 * treatment implemented for a large range of SIMD instruction sets for CPU
 * architectures as well as in CUDA and OpenCL for GPU architectures.
 * Additionally there is a reference CPU non-SIMD and a reference CPU
 * for GPU pair-list setup interaction kernel.
 *
 * The implementation of the kernels is based on the cluster non-bonded algorithm
 * which in the code is referred to as the NxN algorithms ("nbnxn_" prefix);
 * for details of the algorithm see DOI:10.1016/j.cpc.2013.06.003.
 *
 * Algorithmically, the non-bonded computation has two different modes:
 * A "classical" mode: generate a list every nstlist steps containing at least
 * all atom pairs up to a distance of rlistOuter and compute pair interactions
 * for all pairs that are within the interaction cut-off.
 * A "dynamic pruning" mode: generate an "outer-list" up to cut-off rlistOuter
 * every nstlist steps and prune the outer-list using a cut-off of rlistInner
 * every nstlistPrune steps to obtain a, smaller, "inner-list". This
 * results in fewer interaction computations and allows for a larger nstlist.
 * On a GPU, this dynamic pruning is performed in a rolling fashion, pruning
 * only a sub-part of the list each (second) step. This way it can often
 * overlap with integration and constraints on the CPU.
 * Currently a simple heuristic determines which mode will be used.
 *
 * TODO: add a summary list and brief descriptions of the different submodules:
 * search, CPU kernels, GPU glue code + kernels.
