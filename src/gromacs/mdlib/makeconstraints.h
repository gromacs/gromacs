/*! \brief Factory function for Constraints.
 *
 * We only want an object to manage computing constraints when the
 * simulation requires one. Checking for whether the object was made
 * adds overhead to simulations that use constraints, while avoiding
 * overhead on those that do not, so is a design trade-off we might
 * reconsider some time.
 *
 * Using a private constructor and a factory function ensures that we
 * can only make a Constraints object when the prerequisites are
 * satisfied, ie. that something needs them and if necessary has
 * already been initialized.
 *
 * Using the parameter pack insulates the factory function from
 * changes to the type signature of the constructor that don't
 * affect the logic here. */
