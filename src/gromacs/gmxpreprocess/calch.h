 *    nht      : type of hydrogen attachment (see manual)
 *    xh(1.. ) : atomic positions of the hydrogen atoms that are to be

 *    xa(1..4) : atomic positions of the control atoms i, j and k and l
 *    default bond lengths and angles are defined internally
 *
 *    l : dynamically changed index
