 *  \brief Top-level file for generating PME OpenCL kernels.
 * This file includes all the PME OpenCL kernel files multiple times, with additional defines.
 * Plenty of common constants/macros are also expected to be already defined by the compiler
 * (such as "order" which is PME interpolation order).
 * For details, please see how pme-program.cl is compiled in pme-gpu-program-impl-ocl.cpp.
 *
 * This file specifically expects the following work size definitions:
 *
 * - c_spreadWorkGroupSize is a spline/spread kernels work group size.
 * - c_solveMaxWorkGroupSize is a solve kernels maximum work group size.
 * - c_gatherWorkGroupSize is a gather kernels work group size.
