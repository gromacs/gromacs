/*
 * In OpenCL, the structures must be laid out on the host and device exactly the same way.
 * If something is off, one might get an error CL_INVALID_ARG_SIZE if any structure's sizes don't
 * match. What's worse, structures might be of same size but members might be aligned differently,
 * resulting in wrong kernel results. The structures below are aligned manually.
 * The pattern is ordering the members of structs from smallest to largest sizeof
 * (arrays behave the same way as sequences of separate fields),
 * as described in "The Lost Art of C Structure Packing".
 *
 * However, if the need arises at some point, they can all be aligned forcefully:
 *
 * #define GMX_GPU_ALIGNED __attribute__ ((aligned(8)))
 * struct GMX_GPU_ALIGNED PmeGpuConstParams
 * struct GMX_GPU_ALIGNED PmeGpuGridParams
 * etc...
 *
 * One might also try __attribute__ ((packed)), but it doesn't work with DeviceBuffer,
 * as it appears to not be POD.
