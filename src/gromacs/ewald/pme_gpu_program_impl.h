 * \brief
 * PME GPU persistent host program/kernel data, which should be initialized once for the whole execution.
 *
 * Primary purpose of this is to not recompile GPU kernels for each OpenCL unit test,
 * while the relevant GPU context (e.g. cl_context) instance persists.
 * In CUDA, this just assigns the kernel function pointers.
 * This also implicitly relies on the fact that reasonable share of the kernels are always used.
 * If there were more template parameters, even smaller share of all possible kernels would be used.
 *
 * \todo In future if we would need to react to either user input or
 * auto-tuning to compile different kernels, then we might wish to
 * revisit the number of kernels we pre-compile, and/or the management
 * of their lifetime.
 *
 * This also doesn't manage cuFFT/rocFFT kernels, which depend on the PME grid dimensions.
