/* Macros concerning the data layout */

/*
    Here is a current memory layout for the theta/dtheta B-spline float parameter arrays.
    This is the data in global memory used both by spreading and gathering kernels (with same scheduling).
    This example has PME order 4 and 2 particles per warp/data chunk.
    Each particle has 16 threads assigned to it, each thread works on 4 non-sequential global grid contributions.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    particles 0, 1                                        | particles 2, 3     | ...
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    order index 0           | index 1 | index 2 | index 3 | order index 0 .....
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    tx0 tx1 ty0 ty1 tz0 tz1 | ..........
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Each data chunk for a single warp is 24 floats. This goes both for theta and dtheta.
    24 = 2 particles per warp * order 4 * 3 dimensions. 48 floats (1.5 warp size) per warp in total.
    I have also tried intertwining theta and theta in a single array (they are used in pairs in gathering stage anyway)
    and it didn't seem to make a performance difference.

    The spline indexing is isolated in the 2 inline functions:
    getSplineParamIndexBase() return a base shared memory index corresponding to the atom in the block;
    getSplineParamIndex() consumes its results and adds offsets for dimension and spline value index.

    The corresponding defines follow.
