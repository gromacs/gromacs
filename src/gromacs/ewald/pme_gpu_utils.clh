/*! \internal \file
 * \brief This file defines the small PME OpenCL inline device functions.
 * This closely mirrors pme_gpu_utils.h (which is used in CUDA and unit tests), except with no templates.
 * Instead of templated parameters this file expects following defines during compilation:
 * - order - PME interpolation order;
 * - atomsPerWarp - number of atoms processed by a warp (fixed for spread and gather kernels to be the same);
 * - c_usePadding and c_skipNeutralAtoms - same as in pme_gpu_constants.h.

/*! \internal \brief
 * Gets a base of the unique index to an element in a spline parameter buffer (theta/dtheta),
 * which is laid out for GPU spread/gather kernels. The base only corresponds to the atom index within the execution block.
 * Feed the result into getSplineParamIndex() to get a full index.
 * TODO: it's likely that both parameters can be just replaced with a single atom index, as they are derived from it.
 * Do that, verifying that the generated code is not bloated, and/or revise the spline indexing scheme.
 * Removing warp dependency would also be nice (and would probably coincide with removing atomsPerWarp).
 *
 * \param[in] warpIndex        Warp index wrt the block.
 * \param[in] atomWarpIndex    Atom index wrt the warp (from 0 to atomsPerWarp - 1).
 *
 * \returns Index into theta or dtheta array using GPU layout.
