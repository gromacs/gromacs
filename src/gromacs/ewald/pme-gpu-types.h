/* What follows is all the PME GPU function arguments,
 * sorted into several device-side structures depending on the update rate.
 * This is GPU agnostic (float3 replaced by float[3], etc.).
 * The GPU-framework specifics (e.g. cudaTextureObject_t handles) are described
 * in the larger structure PmeGpuCudaKernelParams in the pme.cuh.
