 * Gets a base of the unique index to an element in a spline parameter buffer (theta/dtheta),
 * which is laid out for GPU spread/gather kernels. The base only corresponds to the atom index within the execution block.
 * Feed the result into getSplineParamIndex() to get a full index.
 * TODO: it's likely that both parameters can be just replaced with a single atom index, as they are derived from it.
 * Do that, verifying that the generated code is not bloated, and/or revise the spline indexing scheme.
 * Removing warp dependency would also be nice (and would probably coincide with removing PME_SPREADGATHER_ATOMS_PER_WARP).
