 * \brief StatePropagatorData and associated data
 *
 * The `StatePropagatorData` contains a little more than the pure
 * statistical-physical micro state, namely the positions,
 * velocities, forces, and box matrix, as well as a backup of
 * the positions and box of the last time step. While it takes
 * part in the simulator loop to be able to backup positions /
 * boxes and save the current state if needed, it's main purpose
 * is to offer access to its data via getter methods. All elements
 * reading or writing to this data need a pointer to the
 * `StatePropagatorData` and need to request their data explicitly. This
 * will later simplify the understanding of data dependencies
 * between elements.
 *
 * The `StatePropagatorData` takes part in the simulator run, as it might
 * have to save a valid state at the right moment during the
 * integration. Placing the StatePropagatorData correctly is for now the
 * duty of the simulator builder - this might be automatized later
 * if we have enough meta-data of the variables (i.e., if
 * `StatePropagatorData` knows at which time the variables currently are,
 * and can decide when a valid state (full-time step of all
 * variables) is reached. The `StatePropagatorData` is also a client of
 * both the trajectory signaller and writer - it will save a
 * state for later writeout during the simulator step if it
 * knows that trajectory writing will occur later in the step,
 * and it knows how to write to file given a file pointer by
 * the `TrajectoryElement`.
 *
 * Note that the `StatePropagatorData` can be converted to and from the
 * legacy `t_state` object. This is useful when dealing with
 * functionality which has not yet been adapted to use the new
 * data approach - of the elements currently implemented, only
 * domain decomposition, PME load balancing, and the initial
 * constraining are using this.
