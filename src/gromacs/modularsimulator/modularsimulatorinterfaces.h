 * more than one function is especially valuable for collective elements
 * consisting of more than one single element.

 * \brief The general Signaller interface
 *
 * Signallers are run at the beginning of Simulator steps, informing
 * their clients about the upcoming step. This allows clients to
 * decide if they need to be activated at this time step, and what
 * functions they will have to run. Examples for signallers
 * include the neighbor-search signaller (informs its clients when a
 * neighbor-searching step is about to happen) or the logging
 * signaller (informs its clients when a logging step is about to
 * happen).
 *
 * We expect all signallers to accept registration from clients, but
 * different signallers might handle that differently, so we don't
 * include this in the interface.
