 * Initializes the \Gromacs library for command-line use.
 *
 * \param[in] argc  argc value passed to main().
 * \param[in] argv  argv array passed to main().
 * \returns   Reference to initialized program context object.
 *
 * This function is tailored for use in command line applications.
 * For other usage, combination of gmx::init() and gmx::setProgramContext()
 * provides more flexible initialization alternatives.
 * Unlike gmx::init(), calls to this method cannot be nested.
 *
 * The command line arguments are communicated so that they can be
 * parsed on each processor.
 * \p argc and \p argv are passed to gmx::init(); see there for additional
 * discussion.  This method does not place any additional limitations, but
 * generally there should be no need to pass NULL values.
 *
 * Does not throw. Terminates the program on out-of-memory error.
 *
 * This method is not thread-safe, since it is intended to be the first method
 * called.  See setProgramContext() for additional discussion.

/*! \brief
 * Implements a main() method that runs a single module.
 *
 * \param argc   \c argc passed to main().
 * \param argv   \c argv passed to main().
 * \param module Module to run.
 *
 * This method allows for uniform behavior for binaries that only
 * contain a single module without duplicating any of the
 * implementation from CommandLineModuleManager (startup headers,
 * common options etc.).
 *
 * The signature assumes that \p module construction does not throw
 * (because otherwise the caller would need to duplicate all the
 * exception handling code).  It is possible to move the construction
 * inside the try/catch in this method using an indirection similar to
 * TrajectoryAnalysisCommandLineRunner::runAsMain(), but until that is
 * necessary, the current approach leads to simpler code.
 *
 * Usage:
 * \code
   int main(int argc, char *argv[])
   {
       CustomCommandLineModule module;
       return gmx::runCommandLineModule(argc, argv, &module);
   }
   \endcode
 *
 * Does not throw.  All exceptions are caught and handled internally.

 * \param argc         \c argc passed to main().
 * \param argv         \c argv passed to main().
 * \param mainFunction The main()-like method to wrap.

 * This method creates a dummy command line module that does its

 * This allows the resulting executable to handle common options and do
 * other common actions (e.g., startup headers) without duplicate code
 * in the main methods.
 *
 * \p mainFunction should call parse_common_args() to process its command-line
 * arguments.

 * \code
