 * Context information for writing out command-line help.
 *
 * This class wraps a HelpWriterContext, extending it with information specific
 * for command-line help export.  This way, code using only the routines in the
 * onlinehelp module is not exposed to extra features of the command-line help
 * export.
 *
 * Copying a context works like with HelpWriterContext: the output file and
 * most state is shared.  However, setModuleDisplayName() and setShowHidden()
 * can be set independently for the child context.  Defaults for these options
 * are inherited from the parent.
