/*! \defgroup module_fatalerror Handling of Fatal Errors
 * \ingroup group_utilitymodules
 * \brief
 * Provides functions for handling fatal errors.
 *
 * Exception classes used in the library are defined in the exceptions.h header
 * file.  This header also declares a ::GMX_THROW macro that should be used for
 * throwing exceptions.  It also declares helper functions formatErrorMessage()
 * and translateException() for creating standard error messages and
 * translating exceptions to error return codes.
 *
 * Use of error return codes should be avoided in new code except in C wrappers
 * and similar, but for compatibility, facilities for handling them are
 * provided by the errorcodes.h header file.  It provides a set of error codes
 * (the enum \ref gmx::ErrorCode) that should be used for return codes in functions.
 * It also provides macros ::GMX_ERROR and ::GMX_ERROR_NORET that should be
 * used for returning an error code.  setFatalErrorHandler() is provided to
 * alter the behavior of ::GMX_ERROR and ::GMX_ERROR_NORET.  The default
 * handler prints the reason of the error to standard error and aborts the
 * execution.
 *
 * Header file gmxassert.h is also provided for assertions.  It declares macros
 * ::GMX_ASSERT and ::GMX_RELEASE_ASSERT that should be used for assertions.
