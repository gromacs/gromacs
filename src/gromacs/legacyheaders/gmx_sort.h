/*! \internal \file
 * \brief
 * Portable implementation of thread-safe sort routines.
 *
 * This module provides a Gromacs version of the qsort() routine defined.
 * It is not highly optimized, but it is thread safe, i.e. multiple threads
 * can simultaneously call gmx_qsort() with different data.
 *
 * The rational is that some implementations of qsort() are not threadsafe.
 * For instance qsort in glibc contains a bug which makes it non-threadsafe:
 * http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11655
 * On the other hand, system qsort might be faster than our own.

 * Portable thread-safe sort routine.

 * \param base    Pointer to first element in list to sort
 * \param nmemb   Number of elements in list
 * \param size    Size in bytes of each element
 * \param compar  Comparison function that takes two pointers to elements
 *                being compared as arguments.  The function should return an
 *                integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the
 *                first argument is considered to be respectively less than,
 *                equal to, or greater than the second.
