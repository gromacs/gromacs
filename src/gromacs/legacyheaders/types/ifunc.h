 * known. Within the function only the atomid part of the iatoms[] array
 * is supplied, not the type field (see also t_ilist). The function
 * returns the potential energy. If pbc==NULL the coordinates in x are
 * assumed to be such that no calculation of PBC is necessary,
 * If pbc!=NULL a full PBC calculation is performed.
 * If g!=NULL it is used for determining the shift forces.
 * With domain decomposition ddgatindex can be used for getting global
 * atom numbers for warnings and error messages.
 * ddgatindex is NULL when domain decomposition is not used.
