 * This should only be called one of the following two situations:
 * 1) On all nodes in cr->mpi_comm_mysim, with cr!=NULL,dd==NULL.
 * 2) On all nodes in dd->mpi_comm_all,   with cr==NULL,dd!=NULL.
 * This will call MPI_Finalize instead of MPI_Abort when possible,
 * This is useful for handling errors in code that is executed identically
 * for all processes.
