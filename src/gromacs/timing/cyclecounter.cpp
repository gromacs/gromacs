/*! \brief Calculate number of seconds per cycle tick on host
 *
 *  This routine runs a timer loop to calibrate the number of
 *  seconds per the units returned fro gmx_cycles_read().
 *
 *  \param  sampletime Minimum real sample time. It takes some trial-and-error
 *          to find the correct delay loop size, so the total runtime of
 *          this routine is about twice this time.
 *  \return Number of seconds per cycle unit. If it is not possible to
 *          calculate on this system (for whatever reason) the return value
 *          will be -1, so check that it is positive before using it.
