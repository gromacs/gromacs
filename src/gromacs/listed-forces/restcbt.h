/*! \brief Compute factors for restricted dihedral potentials.
 *
 * The restricted dihedral potential is the equivalent of the restricted bending potential
 * for the dihedral angle. It imposes the dihedral angle to have only one equilibrium value.
 * This potential is calculated using the formula:
 * \f[V_{\rm ReT}(\phi_i) = \frac{1}{2} k_{\phi} \frac{(\cos\phi_i - \cos\phi_0)^2}{\sin^2\phi_i}\f]
 * (see section "Proper dihedrals: Restricted torsion potential" from the manual).
 * The derivative of the restricted dihedral potential is calculated as:
 * \f[\frac{\partial V_{\rm ReT}(\phi_i)} {\partial \vec r_{k}} = \frac{dV_{\rm ReT}(\phi_i)}{dcos\phi_i} \frac{\partial cos\phi_i}{\partial \vec r_{k}}\f]
 * where all the derivatives of the dihedral angle with respect to Cartesian coordinates
 * are calculated as in Allen & Tildesley (pp. 330-332). Factors factor_phi_*  are coming from the
 * derivatives of the torsion angle (phi) with respect to the beads ai, aj, ak, al, (four) coordinates
 * and they are multiplied in the force computations with the particle distance
 * stored in parameters delta_ante, delta_crnt, delta_post.

/*! \brief Compute factors for combined bending-torsion (CBT) potentials.
 *
 * The combined bending-torsion potential goes to zero in a very smooth manner, eliminating the numerical
 * instabilities, when three coarse-grained particles align and the dihedral angle and standard
 * dihedral potentials cannot be calculated. The CBT potential is calculated using the formula:
 * \f[V_{\rm CBT}(\theta_{i-1}, \theta_i, \phi_i) = k_{\phi} \sin^3\theta_{i-1} \sin^3\theta_{i}
 * \sum_{n=0}^4 { a_n \cos^n\phi_i}\f] (see section "Proper dihedrals: Combined bending-torsion potential" from the manual).
 * It contains in its expression not only the dihedral angle \f$\phi\f$
 * but also \f$\theta_{i-1}\f$ (denoted as theta_ante below) and \f$\theta_{i}\f$ (denoted as theta_post below)
 * --- the adjacent bending angles. The derivative of the CBT potential is calculated as:
 * \f[\frac{\partial V_{\rm CBT}(\theta_{i-1},\theta_i,\phi_i)} {\partial \vec r_{l}} =  \frac{\partial V_
 * {\rm CBT}}{\partial \theta_{i-1}} \frac{\partial \theta_{i-1}}{\partial \vec r_{l}} +
 * \frac{\partial V_{\rm CBT}}{\partial \phi_{i    }} \frac{\partial \phi_{i    }}{\partial \vec r_{l}}\f]
 * where all the derivatives of the angles with respect to Cartesian coordinates are calculated as
 * in Allen & Tildesley (pp. 330-332). Factors f_phi_* come from  the derivatives of the torsion angle
 * with respect to the beads ai, aj, ak, al (four) coordinates; f_theta_ante_* come from the derivatives of
 * the bending angle theta_ante (theta_{i-1} in formula above) with respect to the beads ai, aj, ak (three
 * particles) coordinates and f_theta_post_* come from the derivatives of  the bending angle theta_post
 * (theta_{i} in formula above) with respect to the beads aj, ak, al (three particles) coordinates.
