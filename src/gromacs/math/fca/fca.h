 * \brief
 * FCA of a trajectory follows the spirit of
 * PCA in finding important modes of motion through an orthonormal
 * coordinate transformation and subsequent sorting of basis
 * vectors. It has been developed inside the trajectoryanlysis
 * framework. Orignal code from Oliver Lange, then ported to
 * gromacs4.6 by Christian Blau, and current patch by Berenger Bramas.
 *
 * Fixes #2005
 *
 * Implementation according to: Lange, Oliver F., and
 * Helmut Grubm√ºller. "Full correlation analysis of conformational
 * protein dynamics." Proteins: Structure, Function, and
 * Bioinformatics 70.4 (2008): 1294-1312..
