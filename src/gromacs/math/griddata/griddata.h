/*! \defgroup module_griddata Data On N-dimensional Regular Grids
 * \ingroup group_utilitymodules
 * \brief
 * Provides functionality for data manipulation on N-dimensional grids.
 *
 * To represent data on N-dimensional grids, a linear data vector is adressed
 * with a multi-dimensional index on an N-dimensional lattice (\ref gmx::ColumnMajorLattice).
 * To relate this lattice to coordinates, a vector basis is added to the lattice
 * that translates external coordinates into an internal grid representation (\ref gmx::CanonincalVectorBasis).
 * The \ref gmx::Grid combines lattice indexing and spacial representation with a vector basis.
 * Grids have the responsibility to place N-dimensional multi-indices in space
 * and may be equipped with additional properties like translation (\ref gmx::GridWithTranslation)
 * and periodicity (not implemented yet).
