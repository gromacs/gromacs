/*! \brief CUDA bucket sci sort kernel.
 *
 *  Sorts sci in order from most to least neighbours, using the count sort algorithm
 *
 *  Unlike the cpu version of sci sort, this kernel uses counts which only contain pairs which have
 *  not been masked out, giving an ordering which more accurately represents the work which will be
 *  done in the non bonded force kernel. The counts themselves are generated in the prune kernel.
 *
 *  Inputs:
 *   - plist.sci = unsorted pair list
 *   - plist.sorting.sciCount[i] = total number of sci with exactly i neighbours
 *   - plist.sorting.sciOffset = exclusive prefix sum of sciCount.
 *     plist.sorting.sciOffset[i] represents the offset that the first sci with i neighbours will
 *     have in the sorted sci list. All other sci with i neighbours will be placed randomly in
 * positions plist.sorting.sciOffset[i] to plist.sorting.sciOffset[i+1] exclusive
