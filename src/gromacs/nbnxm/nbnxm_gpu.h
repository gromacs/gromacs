/*! \brief
 * Launch asynchronously the nonbonded prune-only kernel.
 *
 *  The local and non-local list pruning are launched in their separate streams.
 *
 *  Notes for future scheduling tuning:
 *  Currently we schedule the dynamic pruning between two MD steps *after* both local and
 *  nonlocal force D2H transfers completed. We could launch already after the cpyback
 *  is launched, but we want to avoid prune kernels (especially in the non-local
 *  high prio-stream) competing with nonbonded work.
 *
 *  However, this is not ideal as this schedule does not expose the available
 *  concurrency. The dynamic pruning kernel:
 *    - should be allowed to overlap with any task other than force compute, including
 *      transfers (F D2H and the next step's x H2D as well as force clearing).
 *    - we'd prefer to avoid competition with non-bonded force kernels belonging
 *      to the same rank and ideally other ranks too.
 *
 *  In the most general case, the former would require scheduling pruning in a separate
 *  stream and adding additional event sync points to ensure that force kernels read
 *  consistent pair list data. This would lead to some overhead (due to extra
 *  cudaStreamWaitEvent calls, 3-5 us/call) which we might be able to live with.
 *  The gains from additional overlap might not be significant as long as
 *  update+constraints anyway takes longer than pruning, but there will still
 *  be use-cases where more overlap may help (e.g. multiple ranks per GPU,
 *  no/hbonds only constraints).
 *  The above second point is harder to address given that multiple ranks will often
 *  share a GPU. Ranks that complete their nonbondeds sooner can schedule pruning earlier
 *  and without a third priority level it is difficult to avoid some interference of
 *  prune kernels with force tasks (in particular preemption of low-prio local force task).
 *
 * \param [inout] nb        GPU nonbonded data.
 * \param [in]    iloc      Interaction locality flag.

/*! \brief Attempts to complete nonbonded GPU task.
 *
 *  This function attempts to complete the nonbonded task (both GPU and CPU auxiliary work).
 *  Success, i.e. that the tasks completed and results are ready to be consumed, is signaled
 *  by the return value (always true if blocking wait mode requested).
 *
 *  The \p completionKind parameter controls whether the behavior is non-blocking
 *  (achieved by passing GpuTaskCompletion::Check) or blocking wait until the results
 *  are ready (when GpuTaskCompletion::Wait is passed).
 *  As the "Check" mode the function will return immediately if the GPU stream
 *  still contain tasks that have not completed, it allows more flexible overlapping
 *  of work on the CPU with GPU execution.
 *
 *  Note that it is only safe to use the results, and to continue to the next MD
 *  step when this function has returned true which indicates successful completion of
 *  - All nonbonded GPU tasks: both compute and device transfer(s)
 *  - auxiliary tasks: updating the internal module state (timing accumulation, list pruning states) and
 *  - internal staging reduction of (\p fshift, \p e_el, \p e_lj).
 *
 * In GpuTaskCompletion::Check mode this function does the timing and keeps correct count
 * for the nonbonded task (incrementing only once per taks), in the GpuTaskCompletion::Wait mode
 * timing is expected to be done in the caller.
 *
 *  TODO: improve the handling of outputs e.g. by ensuring that this function explcitly returns the
 *  force buffer (instead of that being passed only to nbnxn_gpu_launch_cpyback()) and by returning
 *  the energy and Fshift contributions for some external/centralized reduction.
