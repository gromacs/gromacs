/*! \defgroup module_utility Low-Level Utilities (utility)
 * \ingroup group_utilitymodules
 * \brief
 * Provides low-level utilities for error handling and other tasks.
 *
 * This module provides various low-level utilities for tasks such as error
 * handling and string formatting, as well as helper classes and common custom
 * containers to simplify implementation of other code.  Contents of the module
 * are discussed in more details under the different headings below.
 * Some of the code in installed headers in the module is intended for use
 * directly from code outside the \Gromacs library, but a significant portion
 * is exposed only because other public headers depend on it.
 *
 * Since this module implements error handling, it should be at the lowest
 * level: it should not depend on other modules.  Any functionality needed by
 * the error handling code should also be kept in this module.
 *
 * <H3>Error handling</H3>
 *
 * Exception classes used in the library are declared in the exceptions.h header
 * file.  Most \Gromacs-specific exceptions derive from gmx::GromacsException.
 *
 * This header also declares a ::GMX_THROW macro that should be used for
 * throwing exceptions.  ::GMX_THROW_WITH_ERRNO is also provided for reporting
 * syscall errors, but its use should be mostly limited to within the library.
 * This header also declares helper functions printFatalErrorMessage(),
 * formatExceptionMessageToString(), and formatExceptionMessageToFile() for
 * creating standard error messages.  processExceptionAtExit() provides
 * clean-up code before exiting the program after an exception.
 * To help in cases where bottom-up conversion to C++ is appropriate, macro
 * ::GMX_CATCH_ALL_AND_EXIT_WITH_FATAL_ERROR is also provided to catch all
 * exceptions at C++ to C boundary.
 *
 * Header file gmxassert.h is also provided for assertions.  It declares macros
 * ::GMX_ASSERT and ::GMX_RELEASE_ASSERT that should be used for assertions.
 *
 * \if internal
 * Internally, functions from errorformat.h are used for all the above cases to
 * format error messages to \c stderr.  errorcodes.h provides some common
 * functionality for classifying errors.
 * \endif
 *
 *
 * \if libapi
 *
 * <H3>Basic file handling and streams</H3>
 *
 * The header textstream.h declares interfaces for simple text format streams.
 * Headers filestream.h and stringstream.h provide implementations for these
 * streams for reading/writing files and for writing to in-memory strings.
 *
 * The header fileredirector.h provides interfaces for redirecting file input
 * and/or output to alternative streams, for use in testing, as well as default
 * implementations for these interfaces that just use the file system.
 *
 * The header textwriter.h provides gmx::TextWriter for more formatting support
 * when writing to a text stream.  Similarly, textreader.h provides more
 * formatting support when reading from a text stream.
 *
 * The header path.h declares helpers for manipulating paths as strings and for
 * managing directories and files.
 * The fate of this header depends on what is decided in Redmine issue #950.
 *
 * <H3>Logging</H3>
 *
 * The headers logger.h and loggerbuilder.h provide interfaces and classes for
 * writing log files (or logging to other targets).  See \ref page_logging for
 * an overview.
 *
 * \endif
 *
 * <H3>Implementation helpers</H3>
 *
 * The header basedefinitions.h contains common definitions and macros used
 * throughout \Gromacs. It includes `gmx_bool` for C code, some macros for
 * compiler-specific attributes, and ::GMX_UNUSED_VALUE and ::GMX_IGNORE_RETURN_VALUE
 * for handling warnings about unused values.
 *
 * The header classhelpers.h implements a gmx::PrivateImplPointer template for easily
 * writing classes that use the private implementation idiom.  This header also
 * declares ::GMX_DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN and ::GMX_DISALLOW_ASSIGN macros for
 * class declarations.
 *
 * The header flags.h implements a gmx::FlagsTemplate template for better type
 * safety when using bit flag fields.
 *
 *
 * <H3>Other functionality</H3>
 *
 * The header init.h declares gmx::init() and gmx::finalize() for initializing
 * and deinitializing the \Gromacs library.
 *
 * The header arrayref.h implements a gmx::ArrayRef class for exposing a
 * C array or part of a std::vector (basically, any continuous stretch of
 * memory) throuh a std::vector-like interface.
 *
 * The header stringutil.h declares various string utility routines.
 *
 * \if libapi
 *
 * The header strconvert.h declares string parsing routines.
 *
 * The header gmxmpi.h abstracts away the mechanism of including either MPI or
 * thread-MPI headers depending on compilation options.
 * Similarly, gmxomp.h removes the need to use conditional compilation for code
 * that needs to include omp.h for OpenMP functions.
 *
 * The header messagestringcollector.h declares a gmx::MessageStringCollector
 * class for composing messages with context information.
 *
 * The header sysinfo.h declares gmx_getpid() for getting the current process
 * id.
 *
 * The header programcontext.h declares a gmx::IProgramContext that is
 * used to
 * initialize and access information about the running program, such as the
 * name and path of the executable.  This information is used, e.g., by the
 * error handling code in formatting standard error messages.
 *
 * The header qsort_threadsafe.h provides a guaranteed threadsafe
 * implementation for qsort().
