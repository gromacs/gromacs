/*! \brief Handle startup of mdrun, particularly regarding -cpi and -append
 *
 * If there is a checkpoint file, then prepare to start from that
 * state. If possible/required, do so with appending. If some files
 * are not found when appending should be done, we will instead issue
 * a fatal error to avoid unintentional problems.
 *
 * If there is no checkpoint file, we return a value to indicate a new
 * simulation is starting.
 *
 * On return, \p fnm is updated with suffix strings for part numbers if we are
 * doing a restart from checkpoint and are not appending.
 *
 * The routine also does communication to coordinate behaviour between
 * all simulations, including for error conditions.
 *
 * \throws FileIOError             When the filesystem behavior prevents the
 *                                 user's choices being implemented.
 * \throws InconsistentInputError  When the users's choices cannot be implemented.
