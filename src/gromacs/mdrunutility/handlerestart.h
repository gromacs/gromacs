/*! \brief Handle mdrun restart from checkpoint
 *
 * Use an input checkpoint file only if it is valid (and consistent
 * among all simulations) and the names of output files used in the
 * run that generated it are consistent with those found on disk and
 * present on the mdrun command line. If a checkpoint file is found,
 * and all other conditions are consistent, use it for the restart,
 * otherwise give a fatal error. If a checkpoint file is not found,
 * proceed normally.
 *
 * Append to output files only if an input checkpoint file is used,
 * the previous job part didn't number the output files with part
 * numbers, and the user requested appending.
 *
 * Give a fatal error if members of a multi-simulation are not
 * starting from the same part.
 *
 * Does communication to coordinate behaviour between all ranks of a
 * simulation, and/or simulations.
 *
 * \param[in]    inputHandler       Handles file I/O functionality
 * \param[in]    mpiHandler         Handles MPI functionality
 * \param[inout] mdrunFilenames     Filename parameters to mdrun
 * \param[in]    bTryToAppendFiles  Whether mdrun -append was used (including by default)
 *
 * \throws std::bad_alloc          if out of memory
 * \throws InternalError           if the contents of the list of output filenames in the checkpoint file do not conform to expectations from how they should be written
 * \throws InconsistentInputError  if the output files on disk are an empty or only partial match for the names in the checkpoint, or if checkpoint file is missing and a log file exists
 * TODO check above
 *
 * \returns A RestartInfo object whose members describe how mdrun will
 * operate. If mdrun will be doing a restart from checkpoint without
 * appending, \p fnm is updated with suffix strings for part numbers.
