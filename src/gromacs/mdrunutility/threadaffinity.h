 * Checks the process affinity mask and if it is found to be non-zero,
 * will honor it and disable mdrun internal affinity setting.
 *
 * This function should be called first before the OpenMP library gets
 * initialized with the last argument FALSE (which will detect affinity
 * set by external tools like taskset), and later, after the OpenMP
 * initialization, with the last argument TRUE to detect affinity changes
 * made by the OpenMP library.
 *
 * Note that this will only work on Linux as we use a GNU feature.
 * With bAfterOpenmpInit false, it will also detect whether OpenMP environment
 * variables for setting the affinity are set.
