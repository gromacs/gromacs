/*! \libinternal \brief
 * Formats rows of a table for text output.
 *
 * This utility class formats tabular data, mainly for console output.
 * Each row in the table can take multiple lines, and automatic text wrapping
 * is supported.  If text overflows the allocated width, the remaining columns
 * on that line become shifted.  To avoid this, it is possible to start the
 * output for different columns from different lines (it is the caller's
 * responsibility to check that overflows are avoided or are acceptable).
 *
 * Column definitions are first set with addColumn().
 * To format a row, first call clear().  Then call addColumnLine() to add text
 * to each column (can be called multiple times on a single column to add
 * multiple lines), and possibly setColumnFirstLineOffset() to adjust the line
 * from which the column output should start.  Finally, call formatRow() to
 * obtain the formatted row.
 *
 * A header (column titles and a horizontal line) is printed before the first
 * line.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 * \code
gmx::TextTableFormatter formatter;
formatter.addColumn("Name", 10, false);
formatter.addColumn("Type", 10, false);
formatter.addColumn("Description", 50, true);

formatter.clear();
formatter.addColumnLine(0, "name");
formatter.addColumnLine(1, "type");
formatter.addColumnLine(2, "Description for name");
printf("%s", formatter.formatRow().c_str());

formatter.clear();
formatter.addColumnLine(0, "averylongname");
formatter.addColumnLine(1, "type");
formatter.setColumnFirstLineOffset(1, 1);
formatter.addColumnLine(2, "Description for name");
printf("%s", formatter.formatRow().c_str());

// format other rows by repeating the above code
 * \endcode
 *
 * Methods in this class may throw std::bad_alloc if out of memory.
 * Other exceptions are not thrown.
