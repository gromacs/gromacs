 *  \brief Declares the GPU 3D FFT routines.

 *
 * This backend for OpenCL provides greater performance than clFFT, but
 * its primary purpose is to bypass a clFFT compilation bug and allow
 * GPU-accelerated PME on macOS. OpenCL is deprecated, so we may stop
 * maintaining this backend once SYCL runs on Apple GPUs.
