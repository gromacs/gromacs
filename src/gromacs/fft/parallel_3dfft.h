/*! \brief Initialize parallel MPI-based 3D-FFT.
 *
 *  This routine performs real-to-complex and complex-to-real parallel 3D FFTs,
 *  but not complex-to-complex.
 *
 *  The routine is optimized for small-to-medium size FFTs used for PME and
 *  PPPM algorithms, and do allocate extra workspace whenever it might improve
 *  performance.
 *
 *  \param pfft_setup     Pointer to parallel 3dfft setup structure, previously
 *                        allocated or with automatic storage.
 *  \param ndata          Number of grid cells in each direction
 *  \param real_data      Real data. Input for forward and output for backward.
 *  \param complex_data   Complex data.
 *  \param comm           MPI communicator for both parallelization axis.
 *                        Needs to be either initialized or MPI_NULL for
 *                        no parallelization in that axis.
 *  \param bReproducible  Try to avoid FFT timing optimizations and other stuff
 *                        that could make results differ for two runs with
 *                        identical input (reproducibility for debugging).
 *  \param nthreads       Run in parallel using n threads
 *  \param realGridAllocation  Whether to make real grid use allocation pinned for GPU transfers.
 *                             Only used in PME mixed CPU+GPU mode.
 *
 *  \return 0 or a standard error code.
