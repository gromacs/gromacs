 * Declares the HistogramSize class.
 *
 * The data members of this class keep track of global size and update related
 * properties of the bias histogram and the evolution of the histogram size.
 * Initially histogramSize_ (and thus the convergence rate) is controlled
 * heuristically to get good initial estimates,  i.e. increase the robustness
 * of the method.
