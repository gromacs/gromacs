         * with skipped updates have become local, know exactly how to apply
         * the previous updates. The free energy updates only depend
         * on local sampling, but the histogram rescaling factors
         * generally depend on the histogram size (all samples).
         * If the histogram size is kept constant or the scaling factors
         * are trivial, this is not a problem. However, if the histogram growth
         * is scaled down by some factor the size at the time of the update
         * needs to be known. It would be fairly simple to, for a deterministically
         * growing histogram, backtrack and calculate this value, but currently
         * we just disallow this case. This is not a restriction because it
         * only affects the local Boltzmann target type for which every update
         * is currently anyway global because the target is always updated globally.

         *
         * The local Boltzmann target distibution is defined by
         * 1) Adding the sampled weights instead of the target weights to the reference weight histogram.
         * 2) Scaling the weights of these samples by the beta scaling factor.
         * 3) Setting the target distribution equal the reference weight histogram.
         * This requires the following special update settings:
         *   localWeightScaling      = targetParam
         *   idealWeighthistUpdate   = false
         * Note: these variables could in principle be set to something else also for other target distribution types.
         * However, localWeightScaling < 1  is in general expected to give lower efficiency and, except for local Boltzmann,
         * idealWeightHistUpdate = false gives (in my experience) unstable, non-converging results.
         *
         * \param[in] awhParams              AWH parameters.
         * \param[in] awhBiasParams          Bias parameters.
         * \param[in] dimParams              Bias dimension parameters.
         * \param[in] beta                   1/(k_B T) in units of 1/(kJ/mol), should be > 0.
         * \param[in] mdTimeStep             The MD time step.
         * \param[in] numSharingSimulations  The number of simulations to share the bias across.
         * \param[in] gridAxis               The grid axes.
