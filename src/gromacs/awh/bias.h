     * Check if the AWH constant parameters permit skipping updates.
     *
     * Generally, we can skip (postpone) updates of points that are non-local
     * at the time of the update if we for later times, when the points
     * with skipped updates have become local, know exactly how to apply
     * the previous updates. The free energy updates only depend
     * on local sampling, but the histogram rescaling factors
     * generally depend on the histogram size (all samples).
     * If the histogram size is kept constant or the scaling factors
     * are trivial, this is not a problem. However, if the histogram growth
     * is scaled down by some factor the size at the time of the update
     * needs to be known. It would be fairly simple to, for a deterministically
     * growing histogram, backtrack and calculate this value, but currently
     * we just disallow this case. This is not a restriction because it
     * only affects the local Boltzmann target type for which every update
     * is currently anyway global because the target is always updated globally.
     *
     * \returns true when we can skip updates.
