 * \brief A bias acting on a multidimensional coordinate.
 *
 * At each step AWH should provide its biases with updated
 * values of their coordinates. Each bias provides AWH with an updated
 * bias forces and the corresponding potential.
 *
 * See the user manual for details on the algorithm and equations.
 *
 * The bias is responsible for keeping and updating a free energy estimate
 * along the coordinate. The bias potential is basically a function of the
 * free energy estimate and so also changes by the update.
 * The free energy update is based on information from coordinate samples
 * collected at a constant bias potential, between updates.
 *
 * The bias keeps a grid with coordinate points that organizes spatial
 * information about the coordinate. The grid has the the same geometry
 * as the coordinate, i.e. they have the same dimensionality and periodicity
 * (if any). The number of points in the grid sets the resolution of
 * the collected data and its extent defines the sampling region of interest.
 *
 * Each coordinate point has further statistical properties and function values
 * which a grid point does not know about. E.g., for the bias each coordinate point
 * is associated with values of the bias, free energy and target distribution,
 * accumulated sampling weight, etc. For this the bias attaches to each grid
 * point a state. The grid + vector of point states are the bias coordinate points.
 *
 * The bias has a fairly complex global state keeping track of where
 * the system (coordinate) currently is (CoordState), where it has
 * sampled since the last update (BiasState) and controlling the free energy
 * convergence rate (HistogramSize).
 *
 * Partly, the complexity comes from the bias having two convergence stages:
 * an initial stage which in an heuristic, non-deterministic way restricts
 * the early convergence rate for sake of robustness; and a final stage
 * where the convergence rate is constant. The length of the initial stage
 * depends on the sampling and is unknown beforehand.
 *
 * Another complexity comes from the fact that coordinate points,
 * for sake of efficiency in the case of many grid points, are typically
 * only accessed in recently sampled regions even though the free energy
 * update is inherently global and affects all points.
 * The bias allows points thay are non-local at the time the update
 * was issued to postpone ("skip", as it is called in the code) the update.
 * A non-local point is defined as a point which has not been sampled since
 * the last update. Local points are points that have been sampled since
 * the last update. The (current) set of local points are kept track of by
 * the bias state and reset after every update. An update is called local
 * if it only updates local points. Non-local points will temporarily "skip"
 * the update until next time they are local (or when a global update
 * is issued). For this to work, the bias keeps a global "clock"
 * (in HistogramSize) of the number of issued updates. Each PointState
 * also has its own local "clock" with the counting the number of updates
 * it has pulled through. When a point updates its state it asserts
 * that its local clock is synchronized with the global clock.
