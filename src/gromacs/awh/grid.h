 * \brief
 * This file contains datatypes and function declarations necessary
 * for AWH to interface with the grid code.
 *
 * The grid organizes spatial properties of the AWH coordinate points.
 * This includes traversing points in a specific order, locating
 * neighboring points and calculating distances. Multiple dimensions
 * as well as periodic dimensions are supported.
 *
 * \todo: Replace this by a more generic grid class once that is available.
