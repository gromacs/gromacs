 * All interaction from the outside happens through the Bias class, which
 * holds important helper classes such as DimParams and Grid.
 * This class holds many methods, but more are const methods that compute

 * \brief The state of a bias.
 *
 * The bias state has the current coordinate state: its value and the grid point
 * it maps to (the grid point of the umbrella potential if needed). It contains
 * a vector with the state for each point on the grid. It also
 * counts the number of updates issued and tracks which points have been sampled
 * since last update. Finally, the convergence state is a global property set
 * ultimately by the histogram size histogramSize in the sub-class HistogramSize,
 * since the update sizes are ~ 1/histogramSize.

         * however, global need to be performed. Besides the actual free energy update, this
         * function takes care of ensuring future convergence of the free energy. Convergence
         * is obtained by increasing the size of the reference weight histogram in a controlled
         * (sometimes dynamic) manner. Also, there are AWH variables that are direct functions
         * of the free energy or sampling history that need to be updated here, namely the target
         * distribution and the bias function.
