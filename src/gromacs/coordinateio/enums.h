 * The enums here define the flags specifying the requirements
 * of different outputadapter modules.
 *
 * When building the object for deciding on the output to a new coordinate file,
 * the CoordinateFile object needs to be able to validate that the dependencies of
 * attached IOutputAdapters are fulfilled. Classes and interfaces that use
 * the enum can check their dependencies against the information encoded in the
 * flags and can then perform an appropriate reaction if there is a mismatch.
 * \todo Use std::bitset<16> for the entries.
