 * Factory function for TrajectoryFrameWriter.
 *
 * Used to initialize a new instance of TrajectoryFrameWriter with the user supplied information
 * for writing trajectory data to disk. Information needed is the file type, file name
 * corresponding to the type, if available topology information and selection information.
 *
 * If supplied, the modules contained within \p adapters are registered on
 * the TrajectoryFrameWriter if possible.

 * The factory function is responsible for the initial santity checks concerning file types and
 * availability of topology information, with the registration of modules being the second part.
