/*!\brief
 * CoordinateOutput class for handling trajectory file flag setting and processing.
 *
 * This interface provides the base point upon which modules that modify trajectory frame
 * datastructures should be build. The interface itself does not provide any direct means
 * to modify the data, but only gives the virtual method to perform work on a
 * t_trxframe object.
 *
 * This interface also includes the header for the ModuleRequirements, so that
 * derived modules can determine if they are compatible with an output method.
