/*! \brief
 * Parallelizable data container for raw data.
 *
 * This is the main class used to implement parallelizable data processing in
 * analysis tools.  It is used by first creating an object and setting its
 * properties using setDataSetCount(), setColumnCount() and setMultipoint(),
 * and attaching necessary modules using addModule() etc.  Then one or more
 * AnalysisDataHandle objects can be created using startData().  Each data
 * handle can then be independently used to provide data frames (each frame
 * must be provided by a single handle, but different frames can be freely
 * mixed between the handles).  The finishFrameSerial() method must be called
 * in serial for each frame, after one of the handles has been used to provide
 * the data for that frame.  When all data has been provided, the handles
 * are destroyed using finishData() (or AnalysisDataHandle::finishData()).
 *
 * When used through the trajectory analysis framework, calls to startData(),
 * finishFrameSerial(), and finishData() are handled by the framework.
 *
 * \todo
 * Parallel implementation is not complete.
 *
 * \if internal
 * Special note for MPI implementation: assuming that the initialization of
 * data objects is identical in all processes, associating the data objects
 * in different MPI processes should be possible without changes in the
 * interface.
 * Alternative, more robust implementation could get a unique ID as parameter
 * to the constructor or a separate function, but would require all tools to
 * provide it.  With the current registration mechanism in
 * TrajectoryAnalysisModule, this should be straightforward.

/*! \brief
 * Handle for inserting data into AnalysisData.
 *
 * This class provides an interface for adding data frames into an AnalysisData
 * object.  After a handle is obtained from AnalysisData::startData(), new
 * frames can be added using startFrame().  Then values for that frame are set
 * using provided methods (see below), and finishFrame() is called.  After all
 * frames have been added, finishData() (or AnalysisData::finishData()) must be
 * called.
 *
 * For simple (non-multipoint) data, within a frame values can be set using
 * selectDataSet(), setPoint() and setPoints().  Setting the same column in the
 * same data set multiple times overrides previously set values.
 * When the frame is finished, attached modules are notified.
 *
 * Multipoint data works otherwise similarly, but requires finishPointSet() to
 * be called for each set of points for which the modules need to be notified.
 * Each point set starts empty (after startFrame() or finishPointSet()), and
 * values can be set using setPoint()/setPoints().
 * A single point set can contain values only for a single data set, which must
 * be selected with selectDataSet() before setting any values.
 * finishPointSet() must also be called for the last point set just before
 * finishFrame().
 *
 * This class works like a pointer type: copying and assignment is lightweight,
 * and all copies work interchangeably, accessing the same internal handle.
 * However, normally you should only keep one copy of a handle, i.e., treat
 * this type as movable.
 * Several handles created from the same AnalysisData object can exist
 * concurrently, but must currently operate on separate frames.
