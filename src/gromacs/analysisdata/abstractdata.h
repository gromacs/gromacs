//! Smart pointer for managing a generic analysis data module.
typedef boost::shared_ptr<AnalysisDataModuleInterface> AnalysisDataModulePointer;

/*! \brief
 * Abstract base class for all objects that provide data.
 *
 * The public interface includes methods for querying the data (isMultipoint(),
 * columnCount(), frameCount(), tryGetDataFrame(), getDataFrame(),
 * requestStorage()) and methods for using modules for processing the data
 * (addModule(), addColumnModule(), applyModule()).
 *
 * Notice that even for non-const objects, the interface does not provide any
 * means of altering the data.  It is only possible to add modules, making it
 * relatively safe to return a non-const pointer of this type pointing to an
 * internal data structure without worrying about possible modifications of the
 * data.
 *
 * \if libapi
 * This class also provides protected methods for use in derived classes.
 * The properties returned by isMultipoint() and columnCount() must be set using
 * setMultipoint() and setColumnCount(), and notify*() methods must be used to
 * report when data becomes available for modules to process it.
 * There are also two protected pure virtual methods that need to be
 * implemented to provide access to stored data: requestStorageInternal() and
 * tryGetDataFrameInternal().
 *
 * It is up to subclasses to ensure that the protected methods are called in a
 * correct sequence (the methods will assert in most incorrect use cases), and
 * that the data provided through the public interface matches that passed to
 * the modules with the notify methods.
 * Helper class AnalysisDataStorage provides a default implementation for
 * storing data (calls to the pure virtual methods can simply be forwarded to
 * appropriate methods in the helper class), and takes care of correctly
 * calling the notification methods when new data is added to the storage.
 * In most cases, it should be used to implement the derived classes.
 * \endif
 *
 * Currently, it is not possible to continue using the data object if an
 * attached module throws an exception during data processing; it is only safe
 * to destroy such data object.
 *
 * \todo
 * Improve the exception-handling semantics.  In most cases, it doesn't make
 * much sense to continue data processing after one module fails, but having
 * the alternative would not hurt.
