 * Interface for a module that gets notified whenever data is added.
 *
 * The interface provides one method (flags()) that describes features of
 * data objects the module supports. Only most common features are included
 * in the flags; custom checks can be implemented in the dataStarted() method
 * (see below).
 * All other methods in the interface are callbacks that are called by the
 * data object to which the module is attached to describe the data.
