/*! \brief
 * Interface for a module that gets notified whenever data is added.
 *
 * The interface provides one method (flags()) that describes features of
 * data objects the module supports.  Only most common features are included
 * in the flags; custom checks can be implemented in the dataStarted() and/or
 * parallelDataStarted() methods (see below).
 * All other methods in the interface are callbacks that are called by the
 * data object to which the module is attached to describe the data.
 * See \ref module_analysisdata for an overview of the notifications the
 * modules receive, and \ref page_analysisdata for overview of the terminology.
 *
 * Concrete modules typically do not directly derive from this interface, but
 * from either AnalysisDataModuleSerial or AnalysisDataModuleParallel.
 * Both these classes implement one of dataStarted()/parallelDataStarted() by
 * forwarding the calls to the other method of this pair.  This allows the
 * module to only implement the initialization once, without needing to worry
 * how to correctly handle both cases.
 *
 * Currently, if the module throws an exception, it requires the analysis tool
 * to terminate, since AbstractAnalysisData will be left in a state where it
 * is not possible to continue processing.  See a related todo item in
 * AbstractAnalysisData.
