 * \brief
 * Helper class for modules that average values over frames.
 *
 * This class implements common functionality for analysis data modules that
 * need to average a set of values over frames.  Currently, it is designed for
 * computing averages for each input column independently, but should be
 * relatively easy to make more general if required.
 *
 * This class takes care of accumulating the values and computing their
 * variance.  It allows different number of samples for each input column.
 * Accumulation is always in double precision and uses a formula that is
 * relatively stable numerically.  For now, does nothing fancy,
 * but provides ground for other implementation (e.g., related to
 * parallelization) that would benefit all such modules.
 *
 * Methods in this class do not throw unless otherwise indicated.
