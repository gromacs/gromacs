/*! \brief Best alignment to use for aligned pairs of float data.
 *
 *  The routines to load and transpose data will work with a wide range of
 *  alignments, but some might be faster than others, depending on the load
 *  instructions available in the hardware. This specifies the best
 *  alignment for each implementation when working with pairs of data.
 *
 *  To allow each architecture to use the most optimal form, we use a constant
 *  that code outside the SIMD module should use to store things properly. It
 *  must be at least 2. For example, a value of 2 means the two parameters A & B
 *  are stored as [A0 B0 A1 B1] while align-4 means [A0 B0 - - A1 B1 - -].
 *
 *  This alignment depends on the efficiency of partial-register load/store
 *  operations, and will depend on the architecture.

 * \param[out] v2     3rd component of data, base[align*offset[i] + 2] for each i.
 *
 * This function can work with both aligned (better performance) and unaligned
 * memory. When the align parameter is not a power-of-two (align==3 would be normal
 * for packed atomic coordinates) the memory obviously cannot be aligned, and
 * we account for this.
 * However, in the case where align is a power-of-two, we assume the base pointer
 * also has the same alignment, which will enable many platforms to use faster
 * aligned memory load operations.
 * An easy way to think of this is that each triplet of data in memory must be
 * aligned to the align parameter you specify when it's a power-of-two.
 *
 * The offset memory must always be aligned to GMX_SIMD_FINT32_WIDTH, since this
 * enables us to use SIMD loads and gather operations on platforms that support it.
 *
 * \note You should NOT scale offsets before calling this routine; it is
 *       done internally by using the alignment template parameter instead.
 * \note This routine uses a normal array for the offsets, since we typically

 *       is faster even when a SIMD integer datatype is present.
 * \note To improve performance, this function might use full-SIMD-width
 *       unaligned loads. This means you need to ensure the memory is padded
 *       at the end, so we always can load GMX_SIMD_REAL_WIDTH elements
 *       starting at the last offset. If you use the Gromacs aligned memory
 *       allocation routines this will always be the case.

 *
 * \name Higher-level SIMD utilities accessing partial (half-width) SIMD floats.
 *
 * These functions are optional. The are only useful for SIMD implementation
 * where the width is 8 or larger, and where it would be inefficient
 * to process 4*8, 8*8, or more, interactions in parallel.
 *
 * Currently, only Intel provides very wide SIMD implementations, but these
 * also come with excellent support for loading, storing, accessing and
 * shuffling parts of the register in so-called 'lanes' of 4 bytes each.
 * We can use this to load separate parts into the low/high halves of the
 * register in the inner loop of the nonbonded kernel, which e.g. makes it
 * possible to process 4*4 nonbonded interactions as a pattern of 2*8. We
 * can also use implementations with width 16 or greater.
 *
 * To make this more generic, when \ref GMX_SIMD_HAVE_HSIMD_UTIL_REAL is 1,
 * the SIMD implementation provides seven special routines that:
 *
 * - Load the low/high parts of a SIMD variable from different pointers
 * - Load half the SIMD width from one pointer, and duplicate in low/high parts
 * - Load two reals, put 1st one in all low elements, and 2nd in all high ones.
 * - Store the low/high parts of a SIMD variable to different pointers
 * - Subtract both SIMD halves from a single half-SIMD-width memory location.
 * - Load aligned pairs (LJ parameters) from two base pointers, with a common
 *   offset list, and put these in the low/high SIMD halves.
 * - Reduce each half of two SIMD registers (i.e., 4 parts in total), increment
 *   four adjacent memory positions, and return the total sum.
 *
 * Remember: this is ONLY used when the native SIMD width is large. You will
 * just waste time if you implement it for normal 16-byte SIMD architectures.
 *
 * This is part of the new C++ SIMD interface, so these functions are only
 * available when using C++. Since some Gromacs code reliying on the SIMD
 * module is still C (not C++), we have kept the C-style naming for now - this
 * will change once we are entirely C++.
