/*! \brief Prefetch memory at address m
 *
 *  This typically prefetches one cache line of memory from address m,
 *  usually 64bytes or more, but the exact amount will depend on the
 *  implementation. On many platforms this is simply a no-op. Technically it
 *  might not be part of the SIMD instruction set, but since it is a
 *  hardware-specific function that is normally only used in tight loops where
 *  we also apply SIMD, it fits well here.
 *
 *  There are no guarantees about the level of cache or temporality, but
 *  usually we expect stuff to end up in level 2, and be used in a few hundred
 *  clock cycles, after which it stays in cache until evicted (normal caching).
 *
 * \param m Pointer to location prefetch. There are no alignment requirements,
 *        but if the pointer is not aligned the prefetch might start at the
 *        lower cache line boundary (meaning fewer bytes are prefetched).
