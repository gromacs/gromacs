/*! \defgroup module_trajectoryanalysis Framework for Trajectory Analysis
 * \ingroup group_analysismodules
 * \brief
 * Provides functionality for implementing trajectory analysis modules.
 *
 * This module implements a framework for implementing flexible trajectory
 * analysis routines.  It provides a base class for implementing analysis as
 * reusable modules that can be used from different contexts and can also
 * support per-frame parallelization.  It integrally uses functionality from the
 * following modules:
 *  - \ref module_options
 *  - \ref module_analysisdata
 *  - \ref module_selection
 *
 * The main interface of this module is the gmx::TrajectoryAnalysisModule class.
 * Analysis modules should derive from this class, and override the necessary
 * virtual methods to provide the actual initialization and analysis routines.
 * Classes gmx::TrajectoryAnalysisSettings and gmx::TopologyInformation (in
 * addition to classes declared in the above-mentioned modules) are used to pass
 * information to and from these methods.  gmx::TrajectoryAnalysisModuleData can
 * be used in advanced scenarios where the tool requires custom thread-local
 * data for parallel analysis.
 *
 * In addition to the framework for defining analysis modules, this module also
 * provides gmx::TrajectoryAnalysisCommandLineRunner, which implements a
 * command-line program that runs a certain analysis module.
 *
 * Internally, the module also defines a set of trajectory analysis modules that
 * can be instantiated using createTrajectoryAnalysisModule().
 *
 * For an example of how to implement an analysis tool using the framework, see
 * \ref template.cpp.
