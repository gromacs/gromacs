 * \brief Manage the Restraint potentials available for Molecular Dynamics.
 *
 * A simulation runner owns one manager resource to hold restraint objects used
 * in the simulation. In the case of thread MPI simulations, multiple runner
 * instances will have handles to the same underlying resource. With further
 * factoring of the mdrun call stack, this facility can be combined with others
 * into a simulation context object from which simulation code can retrieve
 * support code for a user-configured simulation.
 *
 * Calling code provides the manager with a means to access the various required input data
 * to be used when restraints are computed.
 *
 * \todo This should be generalized as work description and factory functions in Context.
