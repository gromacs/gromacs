/*! \brief Allocate aligned memory in a fully portable way
 *
 *  \param bytes  Amount of memory (bytes) to allocate. The routine will return
 *                nullptr if the allocation fails. However, note that asking for
 *                zero bytes will return a pointer that is non-null and properly
 *                aligned (but obviously you cannot use it, since you promised
 *                not to access data beyond the 0 bytes you asked for).
 *
 *  \param alignment  Alignment specification in bytes, must be a power of 2.
 *
 * \return Nonzero pointer if the allocation worked, otherwise nullptr.
 *  This routine should only be called from alignedMalloc(), which also does
 *  the checking for valid values. This particular function is used for platforms
 *  where we have no control of the alignment of memory returned by the system.
 *  Instead, we increase the amount of memory requested internally such that we
 *  both can create a pointer inside this memory that fulfills the memory
 *  alignment requested, and that we have room to store the original pointer
 *  just before this area.
 *
 *  \note This is an internal routine that should only be called from
 *        gmx::alignedMalloc(). Just like system-provided routines, it provides
 *        memory that is aligned - but not padded.
