 * \brief
 * C-style memory allocation routines for \Gromacs.
 *
 * This header provides macros snew(), srenew(), smalloc(), and sfree() for
 * C-style memory management.  Additionally, snew_aligned() and sfree_aligned() are
 * provided for managing memory with a specified byte alignment.
 *
 * If an allocation fails, the program is halted by calling gmx_fatal(), which
 * outputs source file and line number and the name of the variable involved.
 * This frees calling code from the trouble of checking the result of the
 * allocations everywhere.  It also provides a location for centrally logging
 * memory allocations for diagnosing memory usage (currently can only enabled
 * by changing the source code).  Additionally, sfree() works also with a
 * `NULL` parameter, which standard free() does not.
 *
 * The macros forward the calls to functions save_malloc(), save_calloc(),
 * save_realloc(), save_free(), save_calloc_aligned(), and save_free_aligned().
 * There are a few low-level locations in \Gromacs that call these directly,
 * but generally the macros should be used.
 * save_malloc_aligned() exists for this purpose, although there is no macro to
 * invoke it.

/*! \name Implementation templates for C++ memory allocation macros
 *
 * These templates are used to implement the snew() etc. macros for C++, where
 * an explicit cast is needed from `void *` (the return value of the allocation
 * wrapper functions) to the type of \p ptr.
 *
 * Having these as `static` avoid some obscure bugs if several files define
 * distinct data structures with identical names and allocate memory for them
 * using snew().  By the C++ standard, such declarations cause undefined
 * behavior, but can be difficult to spot in the existing C code.
 * Without the `static` (and if the compiler does not inline the calls), the
 * linker cannot that data structures with identical names are actually
 * different and links calls to these template functions incorrectly, which can
 * result in allocation of an incorrect amount of memory if the element size is
 * computed within the function.
 *
 * The size cannot be passed as a parameter to the function either, since that
 * provokes warnings from cppcheck for some invocations, where a complex
 * expression is passed as \p ptr.
