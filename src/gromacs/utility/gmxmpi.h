 * \brief
 * Wraps mpi.h usage in Gromacs.
 *
 * This header wraps the MPI header <mpi.h>, and should be included instead of
 * that one.  It abstracts away the case that depending on compilation
 * settings, MPI routines may be provided by <mpi.h> or by thread-MPI.
 * In the absence of MPI, this header still declares some types for
 * convenience.  It also disables MPI C++ bindings that can cause compilation
 * issues.
