/*! \file
 * \brief
 * Wraps <mpi.h> usage in Gromacs.
 *
 * This header wraps the MPI header <mpi.h>, and should be included instead of
 * that one.  It abstracts away the case that depending on compilation
 * settings, MPI routines may be provided by <mpi.h> or by thread-MPI.
 * In the absence of MPI, this header still declares some types for
 * convenience.  It also disables MPI C++ bindings that can cause compilation
 * issues.
 *
 * \todo
 * This header is installed because commrec.h depends on it; it would be good
 * to encapsulate this dependency within the library, making the public
 * interface less dependent on the compilation options.
