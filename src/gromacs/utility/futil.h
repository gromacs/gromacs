 * \brief

 * \todo
 * Get rid of this (Redmine #950), or at least remove this from an installed
 * header.  It is not necessary for constructing paths on the systems that it
 * currently supports, and is not reliable in parsing input paths either, since
 * Windows needs to accept both instead of only DIR_SEPARATOR.
