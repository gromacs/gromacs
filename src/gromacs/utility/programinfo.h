/*! \libinternal \brief
 * Helper class for managing information about the running binary.
 *
 * This class provides access to the name of the binary currently running, as
 * well as other information derived from it.
 *
 * ProgramInfo::init() should be called before any other (C++) Gromacs calls in
 * a command-line program, as the information is used for printing error
 * messages.
 *
 * Constructors are provided mostly for unit testing purposes; in normal usage,
 * a single ProgramInfo object is constructed with init() in the beginning of
 * the program.  The returned object can be explicitly passed to other methods,
 * or accessed through getInstance().
 *
 * Unless explicitly noted otherwise, methods in this class may throw
 * std::bad_alloc on out-of-memory conditions, but do not throw other
 * exceptions.
