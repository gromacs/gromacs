/*! \def GMX_RELEASE_ASSERT
 * \brief
 * Macro for asserts that should also be present in the release version.
 *
 * Regardless of NDEBUG, this macro checks \p condition, and if it is not true,
 * it calls the assert handler.
 *
 * Although this macro currently calls abort() if the assertion fails, it
 * should only be used in a context where it is safe to throw an exception to
 * keep the option open.
