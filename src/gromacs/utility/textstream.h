/*! \libinternal \brief
 * Interface for writing text.
 *
 * Concrete implementations can write the text to, e.g., a file or an in-memory
 * string.  The main use is to allow unit tests to inject in-memory buffers
 * instead of reading in files produced by the code under test, but there are
 * also use cases outside the tests where it is useful to abstract out whether
 * the output is into a real file or something else.
 *
 * To use more advanced formatting than writing plain strings, use TextWriter.
 *
 * The current implementation assumes text-only output in several places, but
 * this interface could possibly be generalized also for binary files.
 * However, since all binary files currently written by \Gromacs are either
 * XDR- or TNG-based, they may require a different approach.  Also, it is worth
 * keeping the distinction between text and binary files clear, since Windows
 * does transparent `LF`-`CRLF` newline translation for text files, so mixing
 * modes when reading and/or writing the same file can cause subtle issues.
 *
 * Both methods in the interface can throw std::bad_alloc or other exceptions
 * that indicate failures to write to the stream.
