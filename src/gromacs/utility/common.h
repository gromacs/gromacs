/*! \libinternal \brief
 * Helper class to manage a pointer to a private implementation class.
 *
 * This helper provides the following benefits (all but the last could also be
 * achieved with boost::scoped_ptr):
 *  - Automatic memory management: the implementation pointer is freed in
 *    the destructor automatically.  If the destructor is not declared or is
 *    defined inline in the header file, a compilation error occurs instead
 *    of a memory leak or undefined behavior.
 *  - Exception safety in constructors: the implementation pointer is freed
 *    correctly even if the constructor of the containing class throws after
 *    the implementation class is constructed.
 *  - Copy and/or assignment is automatically disallowed if explicit copy
 *    constructor and/or assignment operator is not provided.
 *  - Compiler helps to manage const-correctness: in const methods, it is not
 *    possible to change the implementation class.
 *
 * Intended use:
 * \code
// In exampleclass.h

    public:
        ExampleClass();
        ~ExampleClass(); // Must not be defined inline
