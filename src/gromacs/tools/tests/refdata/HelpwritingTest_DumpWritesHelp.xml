SYNOPSIS

test dump [-s <.tpr>] [-f <.xtc/.trr/...>] [-e <.edr>] [-cp <.cpt>]
          [-p <.top>] [-mtx <.mtx>] [-om <.mdp>] [-[no]nr] [-[no]param]
          [-[no]sys] [-[no]orgir]

DESCRIPTION

test dump reads a run input file (.tpr), a trajectory (.trr/.xtc/tng), an
energy file (.edr), a checkpoint file (.cpt) or topology file (.top) and
prints that to standard output in a readable format. This program is essential
for checking your run input file in case of problems.

OPTIONS

Options to specify input files:

 -s      <.tpr>                              (Opt.)
           Run input file to dump
 -f      <.xtc/.trr/...>                     (Opt.)
           Trajectory file to dump: xtc trr cpt gro g96 pdb tng
 -e      <.edr>                              (Opt.)
           Energy file to dump
 -cp     <.cpt>                              (Opt.)
           Checkpoint file to dump
 -p      <.top>                              (Opt.)
           Topology file to dump
 -mtx    <.mtx>                              (Opt.)
           Hessian matrix to dump

Options to specify output files:

 -om     <.mdp>                              (Opt.)
           grompp input file from run input file

Other options:

 -[no]nr                    (yes)
           Show index numbers in output (leaving them out makes comparison
           easier, but creates a useless topology)
 -[no]param                 (no)
           Show parameters for each bonded interaction (for comparing dumps,
           it is useful to combine this with -nonr)
 -[no]sys                   (no)
           List the atoms and bonded interactions for the whole system instead
           of for each molecule type
 -[no]orgir                 (no)
           Show input parameters from tpr as they were written by the version
           that produced the file, instead of how the current version reads
           them

KNOWN ISSUES

* The .mdp file produced by -om can not be read by grompp.
