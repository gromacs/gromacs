\section{Methods}
\subsection{Simulation system}
A system of 8 molecules (24 atoms) was simulated.

\subsection{Simulation settings}
A total of 0.05 ns were simulated with a time step of 2 fs.
Neighbor searching was performed every 5 steps.
The PME algorithm was used for electrostatic interactions.
with a cut-off of 0.9 nm.
A reciprocal grid of 32 x 32 x 32 cells was used with 4th order B-spline interpolation.
A single cut-off of 0.9 was used for Van der Waals interactions.
Temperature coupling was done with the Nose-Hoover algorithm.
Pressure coupling was done with the Parrinello-Rahman algorithm.
