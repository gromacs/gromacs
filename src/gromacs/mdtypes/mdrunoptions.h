 * \brief This file declares helper functionality for legacy option handling for mdrun
 *
 * It is likely that much of this content will move closer to the
 * functionality that supports the respective features. For example,
 * modules that change behaviour according to whether it is a rerun
 * could register themselves with the rerun module and get notified at
 * setup time to set their own boolean, rather than rely on a central
 * glob of mdrun options being passed around.
