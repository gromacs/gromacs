/*! \libinternal \brief
 * Interface for handling mdp/tpr input to a mdrun module.
 *
 * This interface provides a mechanism for modules to contribute data that
 * traditionally has been kept in t_inputrec.  This is essentially parameters
 * read from an mdp file and subsequently stored in a tpr file.
 *
 * The main method to implement is initMdpOptions().  This declares a set of
 * options in nested sections.  When declaring options, the module defines its
 * own internal variables where the values will be stored (see \ref
 * module_options for an overview).  The section structure for the options also
 * defines an internal data representation in the form of a generic key-value
 * tree.  This is used to store the values in the tpr file, and also for
 * broadcasting, gmx dump, and gmx check.
 *
 * Implementation of initMdpTransform() is required for populating the options
 * from the current flat mdp format.  It specifies how the mdp parameters map
 * into the options structure/internal key-value tree specified in
 * initMdpOptions().
 *
 * See \ref page_mdmodules for more details on how mdp parsing and related
 * functionality works with this interface.
