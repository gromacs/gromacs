    /*! \brief Constructor
     *
     * The buffers are reallocated only at the reinit call, the padding is
     * used there for the coordinates buffer. It is needed for PME and added at
     * the end of the buffer. It is assumed that if the rank has PME duties on the
     * GPU, all coordinates are copied to the GPU and hence, for this rank, the
     * coordinates buffer is not split into local and non-local ranges. For other
     * ranks, the padding size is zero. This works because only one rank ever does
     * PME work on the GPU, and if that rank also does PP work that is the only
     * rank. So all coordinates are always transferred.
     *
     * In OpenCL, only pmeStream is used since it is the only stream created in
     * PME context. The local and non-local streams are only needed when buffer
     * ops are offloaded. This feature is currently not available in OpenCL and
     * hence these streams are not set in these builds.
     *
     * \note In CUDA, the update stream is created in the constructor as a temporary
     *       solution, in place until the stream manager is introduced.
     *       Note that this makes it impossible to construct this object in CUDA
     *       builds executing on a host without any CUDA-capable device available.
     *
     * \note In CUDA, \p deviceContext is unused, hence always nullptr;
     *       all stream arguments can also be nullptr in runs where the
     *       respective streams are not required.
     *       In OpenCL, \p deviceContext needs to be a valid device context.
     *       In OpenCL runs StatePropagatorDataGpu is currently only used
     *       with PME offload, and only on ranks with PME duty. Hence, the
     *       \p pmeStream argument needs to be a valid OpenCL queue object
     *       which must have been created in \p deviceContext.
     *
     * \todo Make a \p CommandStream visible in the CPU parts of the code so we
     *       will not have to pass a void*.
     * \todo Make a \p DeviceContext object visible in CPU parts of the code so we
     *       will not have to pass a void*.
