 * \brief Declaration of interfaces for GPU state data propagator object.
 *
 * This object stores and manages positions, velocities and forces for
 * all particles in the system on the GPU.
 *
 * For NVSHMEM path it handles the symmetric allocation for coordinates
 * and signal buffers involved in PP GPU Halo Exchange. It also serves
 * as a symmetric allocation point for PME rank for the d_recvBuf
 * involved in the PP GPU Halo Exchange for the sake of keeping
 * symmetric allocation happy.
 *
 * \todo Add cycle counters.
 * \todo Add synchronization points.

    /*! \brief Constructor
     *
     * The buffers are reallocated only at the reinit call, the padding is
     * used there for the coordinates buffer. It is needed for PME and added at
     * the end of the buffer. It is assumed that if the rank has PME duties on the
     * GPU, all coordinates are copied to the GPU and hence, for this rank, the
     * coordinates buffer is not split into local and non-local ranges. For other
     * ranks, the padding size is zero. This works because only one rank ever does
     * PME work on the GPU, and if that rank also does PP work that is the only
     * rank. So all coordinates are always transferred.
     *
     * In OpenCL, only pmeStream is used since it is the only stream created in
     * PME context. The local and non-local streams are only needed when buffer
     * ops are offloaded. This feature is currently not available in OpenCL and
     * hence these streams are not set in these builds.
     *
     *  \param[in] deviceStreamManager         Object that owns the DeviceContext and DeviceStreams.
     *  \param[in] transferKind                H2D/D2H transfer call behavior (synchronous or not).
