/* Helper structure to be able to make essential dynamics / flooding group(s) whole
 *
 * If one uses essential dynamics or flooding on a group of atoms from
 * more than one molecule, we cannot make this group whole with
 * do_pbc_first_mtop(). We assume that the ED group has the correct PBC
 * representation at the beginning of the simulation and keep track
 * of the shifts to always get it into that representation.
 * For proper restarts from a checkpoint we store the positions of the
 * reference group at the time of checkpoint writing.
