/*! \brief
 * Handles interaction of selection options with other options and user input.
 *
 * This class implements interaction of SelectionOption with
 * SelectionCollection, and also implements features of SelectionOption that
 * require actions outside options parsing.
 * It also implements the coupling between SelectionOption and
 * SelectionFileOption.
 * It needs to be added using Options::addManager() before SelectionOption or
 * SelectionFileOption options can be added to an Options collection.
 *
 * The main features of this class are:
 *  - convertOptionValue(), which is used to convert string values into
 *    selections for options.
 *  - requestOptionDelayedParsing(), which is called by the internal
 *    implementation of selection options when an option is provided on the
 *    command line without a value.  Such calls are remembered, and the value
 *    for all requested options can be later provided by calling one of
 *    parseRequestedFromStdin(), parseRequestedFromFile() or
 *    parseRequstedFromString().
