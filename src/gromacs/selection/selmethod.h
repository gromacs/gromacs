 * \page page_module_selection_custom Custom selection methods
 *
 * Custom selection methods are defined by creating a new instance of
 * \c gmx_ana_selmethod_t and filling it with the necessary data for handling
 * the selection.
 * The structure contains callback pointers that define the actual behavior
 * of the method.
 * The following sections discuss how the structure should be filled and how
 * to implement the callbacks.
 *
 *
 * \section selmethods_define \c gmx_ana_selmethod_t data structure
 *
 * An example \c gmx_ana_selmethod_t definition could look like this:
 *
 * \code
   gmx_ana_selmethod_t sm_example = {
       "example", GROUP_VALUE, 0,
       asize(sm_params_example), sm_params_example,
       &init_data_example,
        NULL,
       &init_example,
        NULL,
       &free_data_example,
       &init_frame_example,
       &evaluate_example,
        NULL,
       {"example from POS_EXPR [cutoff REAL]", NULL, 0, NULL},
   };
 * \endcode
 *
 * The first value defines the name of the method.
 * It is used mostly for informational purposes; the actual name(s) recognized
 * by the selection parser are defined by the call to
 * gmx_ana_selmethod_register() (see \ref selmethods_register).
 *
 * The second value defines the type of the value the method returns.
 * Possible values are
 *  - \ref NO_VALUE : This is allowed only for methods that have the flag
 *    \ref SMETH_MODIFIER set (see \ref selmethods_modifiers).
 *  - \ref INT_VALUE : The method returns one or more integer values.
 *  - \ref REAL_VALUE : The method returns one or more floating-point values.
 *  - \ref STR_VALUE : The method returns one or more strings.
 *  - \ref POS_VALUE : The method returns one or more 3D vectors.
 *  - \ref GROUP_VALUE : The method returns a single index group.
 *
 * The third value gives additional information about the method using
 * a combination of flags.
 * Possible flags are:
 *  - \ref SMETH_REQTOP : If set, the topology information is always loaded
 *    and the \p top pointer passed to the callbacks is guaranteed to be
 *    non-NULL. Should be set if the method requires topology information
 *    for evaluation.
 *  - \ref SMETH_REQMASS : If set, masses of atoms is always loaded
 *    and the \p top pointer passed to the callbacks is guaranteed to be
 *    non-NULL and have meaningful masses.  Should be set if the method requires
 *    atom masses for evaluation.  Implies \ref SMETH_REQTOP.
 *  - \ref SMETH_DYNAMIC : If set, the method can only be evaluated dynamically,
 *    i.e., it requires data from the trajectory frame.
 *  - \ref SMETH_MODIFIER : If set, the method is a selection modifier and
 *    not an actual selection method.
 *    For more details, see \ref selmethods_modifiers.
 *  - \ref SMETH_ALLOW_UNSORTED : If set, the method supports unsorted atoms
 *    in its input parameters. \ref SMETH_MODIFIER methods are assumed to always
 *    support unsorted atoms, as their purpose is to affect the ordering.
 *
 * There are two additional flags that specify the number of values the
 * method returns. Only one of them can be set at a time.
 * If neither is set, the default behavior is to evaluate a value for each
 * input atom (except for \ref GROUP_VALUE methods, which always return a
 * single group).
 * Other behaviors can be specified with these flags:
 *  - \ref SMETH_SINGLEVAL : If set, the method evaluates to a single value.
 *    This is automatically set if the type is \ref GROUP_VALUE.
 *  - \ref SMETH_VARNUMVAL : If set, the method evaluates to an arbitrary
 *    number of values.
 *    The number of values is determined based on the values given by the user
 *    to the method parameters (see \ref selmethods_params).
 *  .
 * If either of these flags is specified (and the method type is not
 * \ref GROUP_VALUE), the group passed to the evaluation callback should not
 * be used as it can be NULL.
 * Currently, the above flags only work (have been tested) for \ref POS_VALUE
 * methods.
 *
 * There is one additional flag that can only be specified for \ref STR_VALUE
 * methods: \ref SMETH_CHARVAL . It is meant for to ease implementation of
 * methods that evaluate to strings consisting of single characters.
 *
 * The next two values determine the number of parameters and a pointer to
 * the parameter array. The contents of the parameter array are described in
 * \ref selmethods_params. If the method does not take parameters, the first
 * value should be 0 and the second can be NULL.
 * Currently, \ref STR_VALUE methods cannot take parameters, but this limitation
 * should be easy to lift if required.
 *
 * These are followed by function callbacks that determine the
 * actual behavior of the method. Any of these except the evaluation callback
 * can be NULL (the evaluation callback can also be NULL if \ref NO_VALUE is
 * specified for a selection modifier). However, the presence of parameters
 * can require some of the callbacks to be implemented.
 * The details are described in \ref selmethods_callbacks.
 *
 * Finally, there is a data structure that gives help texts for the method.
 *
 * The \c gmx_ana_selmethod_t variable should be declared as a global variable
 * or it should be otherwise ensured that the structure is not freed: only a
 * pointer to the structure is stored by the library.
 *
 *
 * \section selmethods_params Defining parameters
 *
 * Parameters to selection methods are defined in a separate array of
 * \c gmx_ana_selparam_t structures.
 * The order of the parameters does not matter (except possibly for callback
 * implementation), with one important exception:
 * If the method evaluates to a \ref POS_VALUE, the first parameter should
 * have \ref GROUP_VALUE and be the one that is used to calculate the
 * positions.
 *
 * An example parameter definition:
 * \code
   static gmx_ana_selparam_t sm_params_example[] = {
     {"cutoff", {REAL_VALUE, 1, {NULL}}, NULL, SPAR_OPTIONAL},
     {"from",   {POS_VALUE, -1, {NULL}}, NULL, SPAR_DYNAMIC | SPAR_VARNUM},
   };
 * \endcode
 *
 * The first value gives the name of the parameter.
 * The first parameter can have a NULL name, which means that the value should
 * immediately follow the method name. This can be used to specify methods
 * of the type 'within 5 of ...'.
 *
 * The second value specifies the type of the value that the parameter accepts.
 * \ref NO_VALUE can be used to specify a boolean parameter, other possibilities
 * are the same as for the selection method type.
 *
 * The third value gives the number of values that the parameter accepts.
 * For boolean parameters (\ref NO_VALUE), it should be 0.
 * For parameters with \ref SPAR_VARNUM of \ref SPAR_ATOMVAL, it should be set
 * to -1 for consistency (it is not used).
 * If \ref SPAR_RANGES is specified, it should be either 1 (to accept a single
 * continuous range) or -1 (if combined with \ref SPAR_VARNUM).
 * In all other cases, it should be a positive integer; in most cases, it
 * should be 1.
 *
 * The nest two pointers should always be NULL (they should be initialized in
 * the callbacks), except the first pointer in the case of \ref SPAR_ENUMVAL
 * (see below).
 *
 * The final value gives additional information about the acceptable values
 * for the parameter using a combination of flags.
 * The possible flags are:
 *  - \ref SPAR_OPTIONAL : If set, the user does not need to provide a value
 *    for the parameter. If not set, an error is reported if the parameter
 *    is not specified by the user.
 *  - \ref SPAR_DYNAMIC : If set, the method can handle dynamic values for
 *    the parameter, i.e., the value(s) can be given by an expression that
 *    evaluates to different values for different frames.
 *  - \ref SPAR_RANGES : Can be set only for \ref INT_VALUE and
 *    \ref REAL_VALUE parameters,
 *    and cannot be combined with \ref SPAR_DYNAMIC.
 *    If set, the parameter accepts ranges of values.
 *    The ranges are automatically sorted and compacted such that a minimum
 *    amount of non-overlapping ranges are given for the method.
 *  - \ref SPAR_VARNUM : If set, the parameter can have a variable number
 *    of values. These can be provided by the user as a list of values, or
 *    using a single \ref SMETH_VARNUMVAL (or a single \ref SMETH_SINGLEVAL)
 *    method.
 *  - \ref SPAR_ATOMVAL : If set, the parameter accepts either a single value
 *    or an expression that evaluates to a value for each input atom.
 *    The single input value is treated as if the same value was returned for
 *    each atom.
 *    Cannot be combined with \ref SPAR_RANGES or \ref SPAR_VARNUM.
 *  - \ref SPAR_ENUMVAL : Can only be set for \ref STR_VALUE parameters that
 *    take a single value, and cannot be combined with any other flag than
 *    \ref SPAR_OPTIONAL. If set, the parameter only accepts one of predefined
 *    string values. See \ref SPAR_ENUMVAL documentation for details on how
 *    to specify the acceptable values.
 *
 *
 * \section selmethods_callbacks Implementing callbacks
 *
 * There are eight differen callback functions that can be implemented for
 * selection methods: sel_datafunc(), sel_posfunc(), sel_initfunc(),
 * sel_outinitfunc(), sel_freefunc(), sel_framefunc(), and two update functions.
 * They are in this order in the \c gmx_ana_selmethod_t data structure.
 * In general, any of the callbacks can be NULL, but the presence of
 * parameters or other callbacks imposes some restrictions:
 *  - sel_datafunc() should be provided if the method takes parameters.
 *  - sel_initfunc() should be provided if the method takes
 *    any parameters with the \ref SPAR_VARNUM or \ref SPAR_ATOMVAL flags,
 *    except if those parameters have a \ref POS_VALUE.
 *  - sel_outinitfunc() should be provided for \ref POS_VALUE methods
 *    and \ref SMETH_VARNUMVAL methods.
 *  - sel_freefunc() should be provided if sel_datafunc() and/or
 *    sel_initfunc() allocate any dynamic memory in addition to the data
 *    structure itself (or allocates the data structure using some other means
 *    than malloc()).
 *  - sel_updatefunc_pos() only makes sense for methods with \ref SMETH_DYNAMIC
 *    set.
 *  - At least one update function should be provided unless the method type is
 *    \ref NO_VALUE.
 *
 * The documentations for the function pointer types provide more information
 * about how the callbacks should be implemented.
 *
 *
 * \section selmethods_modifiers Selection modifiers
 *
 * Selection modifiers are a special kind of selection methods that can be
 * appended to the end of a selection. They are specified by adding the
 * \ref SMETH_MODIFIER flag to the \c gmx_ana_selmethod_t.
 * They can have two different types:
 *  - \ref POS_VALUE : These modifiers are given the final positions
 *    as an input, and they can make modifications to the selection that are
 *    not possible otherwise (e.g., permute the atoms).
 *    The modifier should implement sel_updatefunc_pos() and also have
 *    one NULL parameter in the beginning of the parameter list that takes
 *    \ref POS_VALUE and is used to give the input positions.
 *  - \ref NO_VALUE : These modifiers do not modify the final selection, but
 *    can be used to implement per-selection options for analysis tools
 *    or to control the default behavior of the selection engine
 *    (currently, such a framework is not implemented, but should be easy to
 *    implement if required).
 *
 * In addition to restricting the type of the method, selection modifiers
 * do not allow the flags \ref SMETH_SINGLEVAL and \ref SMETH_VARNUMVAL
 * (they would not make sense).
 *
 * Parameters and callbacks should be implemented as with normal selection
 * method, but beware that very little of the functionality has been tested.
 *
 * \todo
 * The modifier handling could be made more flexible and more generic;
 * the current implementation does not allow many things which would be
 * possible with slight changes in the internals of the library.
 *
 *
 * \section selmethods_register Registering the method
 *
 * After defining the method with \c gmx_ana_selmethod_t, it should be
 * registered with the selection engine.
 * In analysis programs, this can be done by calling
 * gmx_ana_selmethod_register().
 * If adding the method to the library, you should add a pointer to the new
 * method structure into the \c smtable_def array (in selmethod.cpp), and it is
 * registered automatically.
 * In both cases, gmx_ana_selmethod_register() does several checks on the
 * structure and reports any errors or inconsistencies it finds.

/*! \brief
 * Evaluates a selection method using positions.
 *
 * \param[in]  context  Evaluation context.
 * \param[in]  pos  Positions for which the method should be evaluated.
 * \param[out] out  Output data structure.
 * \param      data Internal data structure from sel_datafunc().
 * \returns    0 on success, a non-zero error code on error.
 *
 * This function should evaluate the method for each position in \p pos,
 * and write the output values to \p out. The pointer in the union \p out->u
 * that corresponds to the type of the method should be used.
 * Enough memory has been allocated to store the output values.
 * The number of values in \p out should also be updated if necessary.
 * \ref POS_VALUE or \ref GROUP_VALUE methods should not touch
 * \p out->nr (it should be 1 anyways).  For other types of methods, the number
 * of output values should equal the number of positions in \p pos.
 *
 * For \ref STR_VALUE methods, the pointers stored in \p out->s are discarded
 * without freeing; it is the responsibility of this function to provide
 * pointers that can be discarded without memory leaks.
 *
 * If the method accesses \p fr outside the atoms referenced in \p pos or
 * what it receives from its parameters, it must check that \p fr actually
 * contains such an atom in case the \p fr has been loaded from a trajectory
 * that only contains a subset of the system.
