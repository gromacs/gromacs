/*! \brief
 * Provides access to a single selection.
 *
 * This class provides a public interface for accessing selection information.
 * General information about the selection can be accessed with methods name(),
 * selectionText(), isDynamic(), and type().  The first three can be accessed
 * any time after the selection has been parsed, and type() can be accessed
 * after the selection has been compiled.
 *
 * There are a few methods that can be used to change the behavior of the
 * selection.  setEvaluateVelocities() and setEvaluateForces() can be called
 * before the selection is compiled to request evaluation of velocities and/or
 * forces in addition to coordinates.
 *
 * Each selection is made of a set of positions.  Each position has associated
 * coordinates, and possibly velocities and forces if they have been requested
 * and are available.  It also has a set of atoms associated with it; typically
 * the coordinates are the center-of-mass or center-of-geometry coordinates for
 * that set of atoms.  To access the number of positions in the selection, use
 * posCount().  To access individual positions, use position().
 * See SelectionPosition for details of how to use individual positions.
 * setOriginalId() can be used to adjust the return value of
 * SelectionPosition::mappedId(); see that method for details.
 *
 * It is also possible to access the list of atoms that make up all the
 * positions directly: atomCount() returns the total number of atoms in the
 * selection and atomIndices() an array of their indices.
 * Similarly, it is possible to access the coordinates and other properties
 * of the positions as continuous arrays through coordinates(), velocities(),
 * forces(), masses(), charges(), refIds(), and mappedIds().
 *
 * Both positions and atoms can be accessed after the selection has been
 * compiled.  For dynamic selections, the return values of these methods change
 * after each evaluation to reflect the situation for the current frame.
 * Before any frame has been evaluated, these methods return the maximal set
 * to which the selection can evaluate.
 *
 * There are two possible modes for how positions for dynamic selections are
 * handled.  In the default mode, posCount() can change, and for each frame,
 * only the positions that are selected in that frame can be accessed.  In a
 * masked mode, posCount() remains constant, i.e., the positions are always
 * evaluated for the maximal set, and SelectionPosition::selected() is used to
 * determine whether a position is selected for a frame.  The masked mode can
 * be requested with SelectionOption::dynamicMask().
 *
 * The class also provides methods for printing out information: printInfo()
 * and printDebugInfo().  These are mainly for internal use by Gromacs.
 *
 * This class works like a pointer type: copying and assignment is lightweight,
 * and all copies work interchangeably, accessing the same internal data.
 *
 * Methods in this class do not throw.
