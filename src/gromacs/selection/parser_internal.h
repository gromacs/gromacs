 * \brief Helper functions for the selection parser.
 *
 * This header is includes only from parser.cpp (generated from parser.y), and
 * it includes functions and macros used internally by the parser.
 * They are in a separate file to make then easier to edit (no need to
 * regenerate the parser), and to keep parser.y as simple as possible.

 * handle it and allow the parser to continue), and terminate the parser
 * cleanly if necessary.
 * The code calling the parser should use
 * _gmx_sel_lexer_rethrow_exception_if_occurred() to rethrow any exceptions.

/*! \brief

 *
 * There should be no statements that may throw exceptions in actions before
 * this function has been called for all semantic values that have a smart
 * pointer stored.  Together with set(), this function abstracts away exception
 * safety issues that arise from the use of a plain pointer for storing the
 * semantic values.
