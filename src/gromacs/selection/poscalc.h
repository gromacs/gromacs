 * \brief
 * API for structured and optimized calculation of positions.
 *
 * This header declares an API for calculating positions in an automated way,
 * for internal use by the selection engine.  This is useful in particular with
 * dynamic selections, because the same COM/COG positions may be needed in
 * several contexts.  The API makes it possible to optimize the evaluation such
 * that any heavy calculation is only done once, and the results just copied if
 * needed more than once.  The functions also provide a convenient interface
 * for keeping the whole \c gmx_ana_pos_t structure up-to-date.
 *
 * The API is documented in more detail in gmx::PositionCalculationCollection.

 * \brief
 * Collection of \c gmx_ana_poscalc_t structures for the same topology.
 *
 * Calculations within one collection share the same topology, and they are
 * optimized.  Calculations in different collections do not interact.
 * The topology for a collection can be set with setTopology().
 * This needs to be done before calling gmx_ana_poscalc_set_maxindex() for
 * any calculation in the collection, unless that calculation does not
 * require topology information.
 *
 * A new calculation is created with createCalculation().
 * If flags need to be adjusted later, gmx_ana_poscalc_set_flags() can be
 * used.
 * After the flags are final, the largest possible index group for which the
 * positions are needed has to be set with gmx_ana_poscalc_set_maxindex().
 * setTopology() should have been called before this function is called.
 * After the above calls, gmx_ana_poscalc_init_pos() can be used to initialize
 * output to a \c gmx_ana_pos_t structure.  Several different structures can be
 * initialized for the same calculation; the only requirement is that the
 * structure passed later to gmx_ana_poscalc_update() has been initialized
 * properly.
 * The memory allocated for a calculation can be freed with
 * gmx_ana_poscalc_free().
 *
 * The position evaluation is simple: initFrame() should be
 * called once for each frame, and gmx_ana_poscalc_update() can then be called
 * for each calculation that is needed for that frame.
 *
 * It is also possible to initialize the calculations based on a type provided
 * as a string.
 * The possible strings are listed in \ref typeEnumValues, and the string can
 * be converted to the parameters for createCalculation() using typeFromEnum().
 * createCalculationFromEnum() is also provided for convenience.
