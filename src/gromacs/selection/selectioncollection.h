 * Collection of selections.
 *
 * Some default values must then be set with
 * gmx_ana_selcollection_set_refpostype() and
 * gmx_ana_selcollection_set_outpostype().
 *
 * After setting the default values, one or more selections can be parsed
 * with one or more calls to parseFromStdin(), parseFromFile(), and/or
 * parseFromString().  After all selections are parsed, the topology must be
 * set with setTopology() unless requiresTopology() returns false (the topology
 * can also be set earlier).  Once all selections are parsed, they must be
 * compiled all at once using compile().
 * After compilation, dynamic selections have the maximum number of atoms they
 * can evaluate to, but positions have undefined values.  evaluate() can be
 * used to update the selections for a new frame.
 * evaluateFinal() can be called after all the frames have been processed to
 * restore the selection values back to the ones they were after compile().
 *
 * At any point, requiresTopology() can be called to see whether the
 * information provided so far requires loading the topology.
 * printTree() can be used to print the internal representation of the
 * selections (mostly useful for debugging).
