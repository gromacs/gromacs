/*! \brief
 * Collection of selections.
 *
 * This class is the main interface to the core of the selection engine.
 * It is used to initialize and manage a collection of selections that share
 * the same topology.  Selections within one collection can share variables and
 * can be optimized together.  Selections from two different collections do not
 * interact.
 *
 * The constructor creates an empty selection collection object.  To initialize
 * the object, either call initOptions(), or both setReferencePosType() and
 * setOutputPosType().  See these methods for more details on the
 * initialization options.
 *
 * After setting the default values, one or more selections can be parsed with
 * one or more calls to parseFromStdin(), parseFromFile(), and/or
 * parseFromString().  After all selections are parsed, the topology must be
 * set with setTopology() unless requiresTopology() returns false (the topology
 * can also be set earlier).
 * setIndexGroups() must also be called if external index group references are
 * used in the selections; it can be called at any point before compile().
 * Once all selections are parsed, they must be compiled all at once using
 * compile().
 *
 * After compilation, dynamic selections have the maximum number of atoms they
 * can evaluate to, but positions have undefined values (see \ref Selection and
 * SelectionPosition).  evaluate() can be used to update the selections for a
 * new frame.  evaluateFinal() can be called after all the frames have been
 * processed to restore the selection values back to the ones they were after
 * compile().
 *
 * At any point, requiresTopology() can be called to see whether the
 * information provided so far requires loading the topology.
 * printTree() can be used to print the internal representation of the
 * selections (mostly useful for debugging).
 *
 * Note that for trajectory analysis using TrajectoryAnalysisModule, the
 * SelectionCollection object is managed by Gromacs, and \ref Selection objects
 * are obtained from SelectionOption.
