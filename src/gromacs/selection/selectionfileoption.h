 * This option is used internally by the command-line framework to implement
 * file input for selections.  The option takes a file name, and reads it in
 * using SelectionOptionManager::parseRequestedFromFile().  This means that
 * selections from the file are assigned to selection options that have been
 * explicitly provided without values earlier on the command line.
 *
 * Public methods in this class do not throw.
