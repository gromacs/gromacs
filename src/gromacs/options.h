/*! \defgroup module_options Extensible Handling of Options
 * \ingroup group_utilitymodules
 * \brief
 * Provides functionality for handling options.
 *
 * <H3>Basic Use</H3>
 *
 * Basic interface for providing options is implemented by the Options class
 * and classes defined in basicoptions.h for specifying individual options.
 * Only these are needed if a class wants to provide a set of standard options.
 * When creating an Options object and adding options, it is possible to add
 * descriptions for individual options as well as for the whole set of options.
 * These can then be used to write out help text.
 *
 * Module \ref module_commandline implements classes that assign option values
 * from command line and produce help for programs that use the command line
 * parser.
 *
 * \if libapi
 * <H3>Advanced Use (in library API)</H3>
 *
 * It is possible to extend the module with new option types and/or parsers for
 * option values.
 *
 * To implement new option types, it is necessary to subclass the templates
 * OptionTemplate and OptionStorageTemplate with the type of the values that
 * the option should provide as the template argument.  After this is done, it
 * is possible to add options of this new type using Options::addOption().
 *
 * To implement new parsers, one can use OptionsAssigner, which provides an
 * interface to set values in an Options object.
 *
 * There is also an interface to iterate over all options in an Options object.
 * One should implement the OptionsVisitor interface, and then use
 * OptionsIterator to apply this visitor to the Options object.
