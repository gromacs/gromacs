 * \brief Coupling of the accelerated weight histogram method (AWH) with the system.
 *
 * AWH calculates the free energy along order parameters of the system.
 * Free energy barriers are overcome by adaptively tuning a bias potential along
 * the order parameter such that the biased distribution along the parameter
 * converges toward a chosen target distribution.
 *
 * The Awh class takes care of the coupling between the system and the AWH
 * bias(es). The Awh class contains one or more BiasCoupledToSystem objects.
 * The BiasCoupledToSystem class takes care of the reaction coordinate input
 * and force output for the single Bias object it containts.
 *
 * \todo Update parameter reading and checkpointing, when general C++ framework is ready.

    /*! \brief Perform an AWH update, to be called every MD step.
     *
     * An update has two tasks: apply the bias force and improve
     * the bias and the free energy estimate that AWH keeps internally.
     *
     * For the first task, AWH retrieves the pull coordinate values from the pull struct.
     * With these, the bias potential and forces are calculated.
     * The bias force together with the atom forces and virial
     * are passed on to pull which applies the bias force to the atoms.
     * This is done at every step.
     *
     * Secondly, coordinate values are regularly sampled and kept by AWH.
     * Convergence of the bias and free energy estimate is achieved by
     * updating the AWH bias state after a certain number of samples has been collected.
     *
     * \note Requires that pull_potential() from pull.h has been called first
     * since AWH needs the current coordinate values (the pull code checks
     * for this). Requires that pull_apply_forces() is called after this
     * to take into account the updated pull forces AWH might be applied to.

     * of the current state and elements 1..numLambdas contain the energy of the system in the
