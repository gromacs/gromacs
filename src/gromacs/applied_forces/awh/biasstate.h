 * This class holds many methods, but more are const methods that compute

 * \brief The state of a bias.
 *
 * The bias state has the current coordinate state: its value and the grid point
 * it maps to (the grid point of the umbrella potential if needed). It contains
 * a vector with the state for each point on the grid. It also
 * counts the number of updates issued and tracks which points have been sampled
 * since last update. Finally, the convergence state is a global property set
 * ultimately by the histogram size histogramSize in the sub-class HistogramSize,
 * since the update sizes are ~ 1/histogramSize.
