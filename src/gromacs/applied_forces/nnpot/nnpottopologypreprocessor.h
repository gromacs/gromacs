 * Class responsible for all modifications of the topology during input pre-processing.
 *
 * Inherits from QMMMTopologyPreprocessor and performs the following modifications
 * for a scheme analoguous to mechanical embedding in QMMM:
 * 1) Split molecules containing NNP input atoms from other molecules in blocks
 * 2) Exclude non-bonded interactions between NNP atoms.
 * 3) Build vector with atomic numbers of all atoms.
 * 4) Make F_CONNBOND between atoms within NNP region.
 * 5) Remove angles and settles containing 2 or more NNP atoms.
 * 6) Remove dihedrals containing 3 or more NNP atoms.
