/*! \brief Computes the vector between two points taking PBC into account.
 *
 * Computes the vector dr between points r2 and r1, taking into account the
 * periodic boundary conditions, described in pbcAiuc object. Note that this
 * routine always does the PBC arithmetic for all directions, multiplying the
 * displacements by zeroes if the corresponding direction is not periodic.
 * For triclinic boxes only distances up to half the smallest box diagonal
 * element are guaranteed to be the shortest. This means that distances from
 * 0.5/sqrt(2) times a box vector length (e.g. for a rhombic dodecahedron)
 * can use a more distant periodic image.
 *
 * \todo This routine operates on rvec types and uses PbcAiuc to define
 *       periodic box, but essentially does the same thing as SIMD and GPU
 *       version. These will have to be unified in future to avoid code
 *       duplication. See Redmine task #2863:
