 *
 * \todo CPU, GPU and SIMD routines essentially do the same operations on
 *       different data-types. Currently this leads to code duplication,
 *       which has to be resolved. For details, see Issue #2863

/*! \brief Computes the vector between two points taking PBC into account.
 *
 * Computes the vector dr between points r2 and r1, taking into account the
 * periodic boundary conditions, described in pbcAiuc object. Note that this
 * routine always does the PBC arithmetic for all directions, multiplying the
 * displacements by zeroes if the corresponding direction is not periodic.
 * For triclinic boxes only distances up to half the smallest box diagonal
 * element are guaranteed to be the shortest. This means that distances from
 * 0.5/sqrt(2) times a box vector length (e.g. for a rhombic dodecahedron)
 * can use a more distant periodic image.
 *
 * \todo This routine uses HIP float4 types for input coordinates and
 *       returns in rvec data-type. Other than that, it does essentially
 *       the same thing as the version below, as well as SIMD and CPU
 *       versions. This routine is used in GPU listed forces module.
 *       To avoid code duplication, these implementations should be
 *       unified. See Issue #2863:
