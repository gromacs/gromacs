/*! \libinternal \brief
 * Manages the collection of all modules used for mdrun.
 *
 * This class acts as a central place for constructing modules for mdrun
 * and wiring up dependencies between them.  This class should be the only
 * place that contains the full list of modules, although in the future, some
 * code (e.g., in tools) may benefit from the ability to only create one or a
 * few modules and use them.
 *
 * The general idea is that each module takes care of its own data rather than
 * mdrun having to know about all the details of each type of force calculation.
 * Initially this is applied for simple things like electric field calculations
 * but later more complex forces will be supported too.
 *
 * Currently, where the set of modules needs to be accessed, either a pointer
 * to MDModules is passed around, or an instance of IMDOutputProvider or
 * ForceProviders returned from MDModules.  These objects returned from
 * MDModules call the corresponding methods in the relevant modules.
 * In the future, some additional logic may need to be introduced at
 * the call sites that can also influence the signature of the methods,
 * similar to what ForceProviders already does for force computation.
 *
 * The assignOptionsToModules() and adjustInputrecBasedOnModules() methods of
 * this class also take responsibility for wiring up the options (and their
 * defaults) for each module.
