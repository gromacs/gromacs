/*! \internal
 * \brief Struct to handle setting up and running the different "integrators".
 *
 * This struct is a mere aggregate of parameters to pass to evaluate an
 * energy, so that future changes to names and types of them consume
 * less time when refactoring other code.
 *
 * Aggregate initialization is used, for which the chief risk is that
 * if a member is added at the end and not all initializer lists are
 * updated, then the member will be value initialized, which will
 * typically mean initialization to zero.
 *
 * Having multiple integrators as member functions isn't a good
 * design, and we definitely only intend one to be called, but the
 * goal is to make it easy to change the names and types of members
 * without having to make identical changes in several places in the
 * code. Once many of them have become modules, we should change this
 * approach.
 *
 * Note that the presence of const reference members means that the
 * default constructor would be implicitly deleted. But we only want
 * to make one of these when we know how to initialize these members,
 * so that is perfect. To ensure this remains true even if we would
 * remove those members, we explicitly delete this constructor.
 * Other constructors, copies and moves are OK. */
