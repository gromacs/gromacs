 * \brief Mix-in for homeless MD parameters.
 *
 * This is a catch-all parameter container that can be publicly inherited by
 * Integrator classes that need convenient access to the old style parameter pack.
 * It provides "mix-in" data for Integrator classes that
 * have not been migrated to newer data structures. The const reference fields
 * require initialization on construction, but the POD structure allows
 * aggregate initialization. Thus the base class can only be usefully initialized
 * with a template constructor in the derived class that forwards arguments to the
 * Container mix-in.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *      struct MyIntegrator : public IntegratorParamsContainer
 *      {
 *      template<class... Args> MyIntegrator(Args&&...args) :
 *          IntegratorParamsContainer{std::forward<Args>(args)...} {};
 *      }
 *
 * The IntegratorParamsContainer class is provided to compartmentalize the
 * initialization of the old style parameter pack. As parameters are moved to
 * more modern structures, this class can have members removed without causing
 * source incompatibilities in derived classes.
 *
 * Aggregate initialization is used, for which the chief risk is that
 * if a member is added at the end and not all initializer lists are
 * updated, then the member will be value initialized, which will
 * typically mean initialization to zero.

 * without having to make identical changes in several places in the
 * code. Once many of them have become modules, we should change this
 * approach.
 *
 * Note that the presence of const reference members means that the
 * default constructor would be implicitly deleted. But we only want
 * to make one of these when we know how to initialize these members,
 * so that is perfect. To ensure this remains true even if we would
 * remove those members, we explicitly delete this constructor.
 * Other constructors, copies and moves are OK.
