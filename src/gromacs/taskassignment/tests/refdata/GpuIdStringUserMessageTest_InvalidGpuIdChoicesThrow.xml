You limited the available GPU IDs to the following possibilities:
  '0,12,12,2,-1,14'
However, the following problems were detected:
  GPU device ID 12 is too large for the set of detected GPUs.
  GPU device ID 12 is used more than once
  GPU device ID 12 is too large for the set of detected GPUs.
  GPU device ID 2 is not for a compatible, available GPU.
  GPU device ID -1 is negative, which is invalid.
  GPU device ID -1 is not for a compatible, available GPU.
  GPU device ID 14 is too large for the set of detected GPUs.
  GPU device ID 14 is not for a compatible, available GPU.
List only unique, non-negative IDs of GPUs that have been detected, that are
compatible, and available for use. These are:
