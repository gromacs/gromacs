   this improves performance very slightly if Nthreads<=Ncores on an 
   otherwise idle system because waits have slightly lower latencies, but
   causes very poor performance if threads are competing for CPU time (for
   example, when Nthreads>Ncores, or another process is running on the

   work in parallel).
