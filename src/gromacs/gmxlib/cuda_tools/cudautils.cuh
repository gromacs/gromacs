   - non performance-critical: these errors are unsafe to be ignored and must be
     _always_ checked for, e.g. initializations
   - performance critical: handling errors might hurt performance so care need to be taken
     when/if we should check for them at all, e.g. in cu_upload_X. However, we should be
     able to turn the check for these errors on!

   Probably we'll need two sets of the macros below...
