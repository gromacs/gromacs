The full version is available from
https://github.com/ORNL/cpp-proposals-pub/tree/master/P0009
SHA1 of the commit used is f433984ba897298069b510aa1311145040dd860c.

The following modifications were carried out:
* reformatted code with uncrustify
* added GROMACS header to all files
* added doxygen comments to all files
* temporarily removed constexpr from functions, so they compile with C++11
* put all headers from bits/ into this directory
* use minimial includes in all header files instead of just including mdspan
* move tests into a subdirectory tests and rename test_foo.cpp to foo.cpp
* renamed tests and test fixture class to match GROMACS conventions
