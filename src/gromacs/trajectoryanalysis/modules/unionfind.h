/*! \libinternal \brief
 * Union-find data structure for keeping track of disjoint sets.
 *
 * Union-find keeps track of a number of items, represented here by continuous
 * integer indices starting at zero, and supports the following operations:
 *  - Initialization puts each item into a set of its own.
 *  - Given two items, merge the sets that contain these items.
 *  - Given an item, find a representative item that is in the same set, such
 *    that queries for items in the same set yield the same value.
 * Merging and querying is supported in amortized constant time.
 *
 * Note that in order to achieve the amortized behavior, querying the structure
 * modifies the internal state, but does not alter the externally visible
 * behavior.

 * The current implementation assumes that the indices are bounded between zero
