 * \brief Topology information passed to a trajectory analysis module.
 *
 * This class is used to pass topology information to trajectory analysis
 * modules and to manage memory for them.  Having a single wrapper object
 * instead of passing each item separately makes TrajectoryAnalysisModule
 * interface simpler, and also reduces the need to change existing code if
 * additional information is added.
 *
 * It is intended that eventually most clients of this class will be
 * analysis tools ported to the new analysis framework, but we will
 * use this infrastructure also from the legacy analysis tools during
 * the transition period. That will make it easier to put those tools
 * under tests, and eventually port them.
 *
 * Methods in this class do not throw if not explicitly stated.
