/*! \internal \brief
 * Test fixture for trajectory analysis modules.
 *
 * This class implements common logic for all tests for trajectory analysis
 * modules.  The tests simply need to specify the type of the module to test,
 * input files and any additional options, names of datasets to test (if not
 * all), and possible output files to explicitly test by calling the different
 * methods in this class.  runTest() then runs the specified module with the
 * given options and performs all the requested tests against reference data.
 *
 * The actual module to be tested is constructed in the pure virtual
 * createModule() method, which should be implemented in a subclass.
 * Typically, the TrajectoryAnalysisModuleTestFixture template can be used.
 *
 * Any method in this class may throw std::bad_alloc if out of memory.

         *  - Sets \p option in the tested module to a temporary file name

         *  - Makes runTest() to check the contents of the file against
         *    reference data after running the module.
         *  - Marks the temporary file for removal at test teardown.
         *
         * \p filename is given to TestTemporaryFileManager to make a unique
         * filename for the temporary file, but is not otherwise used.
         *
         * Currently, this method should not be called for an XVG file, because
         * the comments in the beginning of the file contain timestamps and
         * other variable information, causing the test to fail.  Best used
         * only for custom data formats.  For numeric data, testing the
         * underlying dataset is typically sufficient.
