 * \brief
 * Tests for functionality of the "rdf" trajectory analysis module.
 *
 * These tests are essentially regression tests for the actual RDF calculation
 * from very small configurations.  Exclusions are not tested (since the input
 * does not contain any), nor is the effect of -cut of -rmax.
 * At the moment, they do not test the final normalization, but only the pair
 * counts calculated for each frame.  Tests for the final normalization should
 * be added once related TODOs in the implementation/framework have been
 * resolved (currently, the test framework does not see the final output data).
