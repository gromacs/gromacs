/*! \brief
 * Base class for trajectory analysis methods.
 *
 * Trajectory analysis methods should derive from this class and override the
 * necessary virtual functions to implement initialization (initOptions(),
 * initOptionsDone(), initAnalysis(), initAfterFirstFrame()), per-frame analysis
 * (analyzeFrame()), and final processing (finishFrames(), finishAnalysis(),
 * writeOutput()).
 *
 * For parallel analysis using threads, only a single object is constructed,
 * but the methods startFrames(), analyzeFrame() and finishFrames() are called
 * in each thread.  Frame-local data should be initialized in startFrames() and
 * stored in a class derived from TrajectoryAnalysisModuleData that is passed
 * to the other methods.  The default implementation of startFrames() can be
 * used if only data handles and selections need to be thread-local.
