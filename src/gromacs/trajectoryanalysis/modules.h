 * Creates a TrajectoryAnalysisModule object corresponding to a name.

 *      defined in modules.h).
 * \returns  An allocated TrajectoryAnalysisModule object, or NULL if \p name
 *      is not valid.
 *
 * This function should be used to instantiate selection methods defined in the
 * library.
 *
 * In addition to recognizing exact matches on \p name, the function also
 * identifies cases where \p name is a prefix of exactly one recognized name
 * (exact matches always take precedence).
