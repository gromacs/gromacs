       The function we are trying to zero is fom-x, where fom is the
       "figure of merit" which is the pressure (or the veta value) we
       would get by putting in an old value of the pressure or veta into
       the incrementor function for the step or half step.  I have
       verified that this gives the same answer as self consistent
       iteration, usually in many fewer steps, especially for small tau_p.
       
       We could possibly eliminate an iteration with proper use
       of the value from the previous step, but that would take a bit
       more bookkeeping, especially for veta, since tests indicate the
       function of veta on the last step is not sufficiently close to
       guarantee convergence this step. This is
       good enough for now.  On my tests, I could use tau_p down to
       0.02, which is smaller that would ever be necessary in
       practice. Generally, 3-5 iterations will be sufficient */
