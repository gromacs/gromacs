 * Sort_bonds sorts all bonded force parameters in order of ascending
 * atom id of the maximum atom id specified in a bond per type bond.
 *
 * If, for example, for a specific bond type the following bonds are specified:
 *    bond1 between atoms 15, 16, 12, 18 and 20
 *    bond2 between atoms 14, 13, 12, 18 and 19
 *    bond3 between atoms 17, 11, 19, 21 and 15
 * then the maximum atom id for each bond would be:
 *    bond1: 20
 *    bond2: 19
 *    bond3: 21
 * so order in which the bonds will be sorted is bond2, bond1, bond3
 *
 * This routine is used to determine to which node a bonds should be
 * allocated. For the distribution of bonds it is necessary to keep all
 * the needed atoms when calculating a bonded force on one node. In
 * this way we prevent communication overhead in bonded force calculations.
