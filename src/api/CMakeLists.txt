# If you want to redistribute modifications to GROMACS, please
# consider that scientific software is very special. Version
# control is crucial - bugs must be traceable. We will be happy to

# derived work must not be called official GROMACS. Details are found
# in the README & COPYING files - if they are missing, get the

# To help us fund GROMACS development, we humbly ask that you cite
# the research papers on the package. Check out http://www.gromacs.org.

# Note: GROMACS releases have a single-integer monotonic version in GMX_API_VERSION
# and LIBRARY_VERSION annotates the shared object for libgromacs. GMXAPI versioning
# is not synchronized to releases and may increment faster or slower.
#
# Prior to 0.1, GMXAPI patch levels are used to mark short term development cycles
# and allow compatibility checks for client software of the early releases.
#
# gmxapi 0.1 will be the first release candidate for gmxapi 1.0 and will attempt
# to establish compatibility guarantees consistent with semantic versioning.
# (https://semver.org). When the API is deemed suitably stable, gmxapi 1.0 should
# be tagged. Official GROMACS releases should be mappable to a distinct gmxapi
# release string. For roadmap details, see https://redmine.gromacs.org/issues/2585
