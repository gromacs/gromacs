"""
Provides the gmx.__main__() method for the gmx package main module.
Defines behavior when module is invoked as a script or with
``python -m gmx``

Right now, this is a test/demonstration script. Ultimately, it is
unclear what the gmx module should do when invoked from the command-line
except in some far distant future when perhaps it is used to implement
the gmx command-line wrapper, which is not currently a focus of this work.
