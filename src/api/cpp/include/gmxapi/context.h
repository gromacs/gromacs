/*!
 * \brief Execution context.
 *
 * The execution context represents computing resources and zero, one, or more
 * workflows to execute. All API objects exist in some context, which determines
 * how the API objects interact underneath the hood.
 *
 * A proxy can be configured with information needed to initialize a runtime
 * environment capable of executing a work load, independently of defining the
 * work.
 * The actual execution
 * environment is not necessarily instantiated / configured until the work is
 * performed.
 * Thus, construction of a Context object does not necessarily imply
 * initialization of compute resources, but any active compute resources are
 * appropriately deinitialized when the object is destroyed. However, to allow
 * opportunities for exception handling, resources should be deinitialized when
 * and as work is completed by the Runner.
 *
 * Ultimately, the class in this header file should just define an interface.
 * Implementations for different execution environments will be provided by the
 * library or extension code and documented separately,
 * and it should be straight-forward to
 * write extension code for other execution environments.
 *
 * \todo Further encapsulate resource state transitions with Session objects.
