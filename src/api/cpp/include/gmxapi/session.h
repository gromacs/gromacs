 *
 * Separating run() from construction allows the client to examine the running execution
 * environment or to retrieve the communicator before beginning long-running computation.
 *
 * The session should be explicitly `close()`ed before destruction to allow exception
 * handling during shutdown. The destructor will close() the session if it is not
 * closed already, but errors may be hidden.
 *
 * The session owns a Status object that can be shared and retained by client code
 * for further inspection.
