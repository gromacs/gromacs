 * \brief Deprecated: A wrapper for gmx::Mdrunner
 *
 * Container for molecular model and simulation parameters. It was not intended
 * to end up as such, but gmxapi::System has ended up as basically a
 * wrapper for the gmx::Mdrunner simulator object. As it is, this class does not fit the
 * current gmxapi paradigm and will be removed, reworked, or renamed soon.
 *
 * # Protocol
 *
 * As of gmxapi 0.0.6, a simulation is configured and launched as follows.
 *
 * 1. Caller gets a System handle with gmxapi::fromTprFile().
 * 2. Caller optionally attaches additional MD Modules with getSpec()->addModule(std::shared_ptr<gmxapi::MDModule> module). See gmxapi::MDHolder
 * 3. Caller gets a runnable object by passing a Context to System::launch()
 *
 * During launch() configured gmxapi::MDModules are attached to the simulator, which is
 * then run by calling run() on the object returned by launch().
