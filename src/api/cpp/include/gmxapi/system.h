 * \brief Deprecated: A wrapper for gmx::Mdrunner
 *
 * Container for molecular model and simulation parameters.
 *
 * \internal
 * It was not intended as such, but gmxapi::System has ended up as basically a
 * wrapper for the gmx::Mdrunner simulator object and serves as the aspect of a
 * gmxapi Session that performs simulation work. As such, this class does not fit the
 * current gmxapi paradigm and will be removed, reworked, or renamed soon.
 *
 * # Protocol
 *
 * As of gmxapi 0.0.6, a simulation is configured and launched as follows.
 *
 * 1. Caller gets a System handle with gmxapi::fromTprFile().
 * 2. Caller optionally attaches additional MD Modules with
 *    getSpec()->addModule(std::shared_ptr<gmxapi::MDModule> module).
 *    See gmxapi::MDHolder
 * 3. Caller gets a runnable object by passing a Context to System::launch()
 *
 * During launch() configured gmxapi::MDModules are attached to the simulator, which is
 * then run by calling run() on the object returned by launch().

         * # Protocol
         *
         * The current implementation of System::launch() performs the following actions.
         *
         * When launch() is called, a new gmxapi::Session is created by passing a
         * gmxapi::Workflow to context->launch().
         * The Workflow basically just contains the TPR filename.
         * 1. A new Mdrunner is created from the information in the gmxapi::Workflow
         * 2. A new Session is created using the ContextImpl and the runner
         *
         * Then, for each module available through getSpec()->getModules(),
         * the session and module are passed to gmxapi::setSessionRestraint().
         * 1. A gmx::IRestraintPotential is retrieved from the module.
         * 2. A unique, named SessionResources is created for the module and attached to the SessionImpl.
         *     1. The module is added as a signaller to the session SignalManager
         *        with getSignalManager()->addSignaller(module->name())
         *     2. The SessionResources is passed to IRestraintPotential::bindSession().
         *        Currently, the only thing the restraint could do at this point is to
         *        save a copy of the pointer and later pass it to gmxapi::getMdrunnerSignal().
         *     3. The restraint is passed to gmx::Mdrunner::addPullPotential(),
         *        which adds the restraint to the global gmx::restraint::Manager,
         *        which then needs to be `clear()`ed after the runner completes.
         *
         * Shared ownership of the Session is returned to the caller of launch().
         *
