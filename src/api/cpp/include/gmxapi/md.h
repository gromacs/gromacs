 # Extending MD with custom code.

   Classes deriving from MDModule can interact with GROMACS at a low level to
   extend the native GROMACS functionality. It is an evolving API that will
   allow increased flexibility with further development. Near term functionality
   includes the ability to attach custom code apply restraint forces during
   simulation.

   Below, we show code that extends the GROMACS library, code that interfaces with this
   API, and client code that calls GROMACS with the custom code.
   Sample MD plugin code is available at https://github.com/kassonlab/sample_restraint

   \todo Move this to an example source code file that we can compile and test.

 ## Example

   In client code, extend the GROMACS library by implementing a new restraint
   potential (see library documentation).

   The gmxapi protocol to register a gmxapi::MDModule with a gmxapi::Session
   by passing an gmx::IRestraintPotential to a gmx::MdRunner is described in the
   gmxapi::Session docs. To exercise it, we need to call gmxapi::Session::setRestraint(),
   passing a std::shared_ptr<gmxapi::MDModule> argument.

        class NullRestraint : public gmx::IRestraintPotential
        {
            public:
                gmx::PotentialPointData evaluate(gmx::Vector r1,
                                                 gmx::Vector r2,
                                                 double t) override
                {
                    return {};
                }
        };

   Use gmxapi::MDModule to define an API object class that we can pass around.

        class SimpleApiModule : public gmxapi::MDModule
        {
            public:
                const char *name() override
                {
                    return "NullApiModule";
                }

                // Implement the MDModule protocol.
                std::shared_ptr<gmx::IRestraintPotential> getRestraint() override
                {
                    auto restraint = std::make_shared<NullRestraint>();
                    return restraint;
                }
        };

   C++ client code to run an MD simulation with the custom restraint.

        bool mysim() {
                auto system = gmxapi::fromTprFile(filename);
                std::shared_ptr<gmxapi::Context> context = gmxapi::defaultContext();
                auto runner = system->runner();

                auto session = runner->initialize(context);

                auto module = std::make_shared<SimpleApiModule>();
                session->setRestraint(module);

                gmxapi::Status status;
                status = session->run();
                return status.success();
        };
