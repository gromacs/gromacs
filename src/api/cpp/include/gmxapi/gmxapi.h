 * \brief Header for public GROMACS C++ API
 *
 * API clients include this header. It is intended to provide a minimal set of
 * declarations to allow independently implemented API clients to make compatible
 * references to gmxapi objects. Each client will still need to include additional
 * headers and to link against gmxapi, but clients don't need to be completely ABI
 * or API compatible with each other. Clients should use the gmxapi versioning utilities
 * to check for compatibility before accessing members of an object passed by
 * another client.
 *
 * \ingroup gmxapi

/*! \mainpage
 * The `gmxapi` library allows GROMACS extension and client code to interact with
 * GROMACS internals without compile-time dependence on the GROMACS source code.
 * It is sufficient to use the headers described here and to link against `libgmxapi`
 * CMake helpers make it
 * easy to compile your own code against an installed copy of GROMACS.
 *
 * Using the `Gromacs::gmxapi` CMake target, the headers described here can be
 * included from `gmxapi/...` and symbols in the `::gmxapi` C++ namespace can be
 * resolved in the library by link time.
 *
 * For API stability and unambiguous versioning, headers in the top-level `gmxapi/`
 * directory should not refer to the `gmx` namespace used by the core GROMACS library,
 * except for gromacsfwd.h, which consolidates forward declarations in the `gmx` namespace
 * required by the extension APIs in subdirectories like `gmxapi/md`.
 * \todo gromacsfwd.h probably shouldn't be in the top level either...
 * To reduce dependencies, headers should not depend on headers at a deeper level
 * than themselves, where versioning and compatibility guarantees are weaker
 * (possibly dependent on GROMACS versions) or feature-dependent.
 *
 * Refer to the <a href="modules.html">modules</a> section for a hierarchical
 * overview of the API documentation.

 *
 * \brief Provide external access to an installed GROMACS binary through the gmxapi library.
 *
 * API client code primarily operates on Proxy objects, which can be copied,
 * serialized, and configured independently of execution context, data location,
 * or parallelism.
 *
 * When data needs to be accessed or moved, smart Handle objects are used.
 * DataHandle objects explicitly describe ownership and access characteristics,
 * and so are not copyable, but can have ownership transferred. DataHandle objects
 * should be held briefly, since the implementation can depend on the current
 * execution context and can affect performance.
 *
 * Computation Modules and Runners have Proxy objects whose lifetime is independent
 * of execution context, and Implementation objects whose lifetimes are necessarily
 * bounded by the execution Context in which they run.
 *
 * Proxy and Implementation classes use Interfaces defined by the API, which can also be
 * subclassed in client code to extend the library functionality.
 *
 * The Implementation class supporting a given proxy object is likely to change between
 * successive handle requests, using a "state" behavioral design pattern.
 *
 * API classes participating in behavioral protocols beyond RAII construction and
 * destruction use implementation inheritance or separate manager classes to
 * ensure proper behavior by classes
 * implementing the relevant Interface. E.g. if the API specifies that an
 * Interface requires calls to object->initialize() to be followed by calls to
 * object->deinitialize(), the API library provides mechanisms to guarantee
 * that clients of the interface execute an appropriate state machine.
 *
 * The runner for a workflow cannot be fully instantiated until the execution context
 * is active, but the execution context cannot be configured without some knowledge
 * of the work to be performed. Thus, initialization requires several stages in
 * which the Context is configured with knowledge of the work to be performed,
 * a Session is launched and can provide resources to the computational
 * components at run time.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * A client may create a MDProxy to pass to a RunnerProxy to pass to a Context, optionally
 * keeping references to the proxies or not.
 * The client asks the Context for a Session.
 * Context asks RunnerProxy for a RunnerBuilder, which asks MDProxy for an MD Engine builder.
 * Each builder (and product) gets a handle to the Context.
 * MDEngineBuilder produces and returns a handle to a new MDEngine.
 * RunnerBuilder produces a Runner with a handle to the MDEngine and returns runner handle to session.
 * Session makes API calls to runner handle until it no longer needs it and releases it.
 * Releasing the handle can provide notification to the runner.
 * When no references remain (as via handles), the runner is destroyed (same for MDEngine).
 * In the case of complex shutdown, the Context holds the last references to the runners and manages shutdown.
 *
 * For maximal compatibility with other libgmxapi clients (such as third-party
 * Python modules), client code should use the wrappers and protocols in the
 * gmxapi.h header. Note that there is a separate CMake target to build the full
 * developer documentation for gmxapi: `gmxapi-cppdocs-dev`.
 *
 * # Possible Example
 *
 * Configure a system and work specification from a TPR file, configure locally-detected computing resources,
 * and run the workflow.
 *
 *      std::string filename;
 *      // ...
 *      auto system = gmxapi::fromTprFile(filename);
 *      auto session = system.launch();
 *      auto status = session.run();
 *      return status.success();
 *
 * Load a TPR file, extract some data, modify the workflow, then run.
 *
 *
 *      auto system = gmxapi::fromTprFile(filename);
 *      // Load some custom code:
 *      auto potential = myplugin::MyPotential::newSpec();
 *      // ...
 *      auto atoms = system.atoms();
 *      {
 *          // Acquire read handle to global data in the current thread and/or MPI rank.
 *          const auto scopedPositionsHandle = gmxapi::extractLocally(atoms.positions, gmxapi::readOnly());
 *          for (auto&& position : scopedPositionsHandle)
 *          {
 *              // do something
 *          }
 *          // Release the read handle in the current code block (a shared reference may still be held elsewhere)
 *      }
 *      system.addPotential(potential);
 *      auto session = system.launch();
 *      auto status = session.run();
 *      return status.success();
 *
 * \internal
 * To extend the API may require GROMACS library
 * headers and possibly linking against `libgromacs`.
 * Where possible, though, gmxapi public interfaces never require the instantiation
 * of a gmx object, but instead take them as parameters. The (private) API implementation
 * code then uses binding protocols defined in the library API to connect the
 * GROMACS library objects (or interfaces), generally in an exchange such as the
 * following.
 *
 * gmxapi client code:
 *
 *     MyExtension local_object;
 *     gmxapi::SomeThinWrapper wrapper_object = gmxapi::some_function();
 *     local_object.bind(wrapper_object);
 *     gmxapi::some_other_function(wrapper_object);
 *
 * `MyExtension` implementation:
 *
 *     class MyExtension : public gmxapi::SomeExtensionInterface
 *     {
 *          void bind(gmxapi::SomeThinWrapper wrapper)
 *          {
 *              std::shared_ptr<gmxapi::SomeWrappedInterface> api_object = wrapper.getSpec();
 *              api_object->register(this);
 *          };
 *          //...
 *     };
 *
 * gmxapi protocol:
 *
 *     void gmxapi::SomeWrappedInterface::register(gmxapi::SomeExtensionInterface* client_object)
 *     {
 *          gmx::InterestingCoreLibraryClass* core_object = this->non_public_interface_function();
 *          gmx::SomeLibraryClass* library_object = client_object->required_protocol_function();
 *          core_object->do_something(library_object);
 *     };
 *
 *
 * Refer to GMXAPI developer docs for the protocols that map gmxapi interfaces to
 * GROMACS library interfaces.
 * Refer to the GROMACS developer
 * documentation for details on library interfaces forward-declared in this header.
 *
 * For binding Molecular Dynamics modules into a simulation, the thin wrapper class is gmxapi::MDHolder.
 * It provides the MD work specification that can provide and interface that an IRestraintPotential
 * can bind to.
 *
 * The gmxpy Python module provides a method gmx.core.MD().add_force(force) that immediately calls
 * force.bind(mdholder), where mdholder is an object with Python bindings to gmxapi::MDHolder. The
 * Python interface for a restraint must have a bind() method that takes the thin wrapper. The
 * C++ extension implementing the restraint unpacks the wrapper and provides a gmxapi::MDModule to
 * the gmxapi::MDWorkSpec. The MDModule provided must be able to produce a gmx::IRestraintPotential
 * when called upon later during simulation launch.
 *
 * external Restraint implementation:
 *
 *      class MyRestraintModule : public gmxapi::MDModule
 *      {
 *          // not a specified interface at the C++ level. Shown for Python module implementation.
 *          void bind(gmxapi::MDHolder wrapper)
 *          {
 *              auto workSpec = wrapper->getSpec();
 *              shared_ptr<gmxapi::MDModule> module = this->getModule();
 *              workSpec->addModule(module);
 *          }
 *      };
 *
 * When the simulation is launched, the work specification is passed to the runner, which binds to
 * the restraint module as follows. The execution session is launched with access to the work specification.
 *
 * Possible client code
 *
 *      gmxapi::System system;
 *      // System can provide an interface with which
 *      //...
 *      auto session = gmxapi::Session::create(system);
 *      session.run();
 *
 * Possible API implementation
 *
 *      static std::unique_ptr<gmxapi::Session> gmxapi::Session::create(shared_ptr<gmxapi::System> system)
 *      {
 *          auto spec = system->getWorkSpec();
 *          for (auto&& module : spec->getModules())
 *          {
 *              if (providesRestraint(module))
 *              {
 *                  // gmxapi restraint management protocol
 *                  runner->setRestraint(module);
 *              }
 *          }
 *
 *      }
 *
 *      // gmxapi restraint management protocol
 *      void gmxapi::Session::setRestraint(std::shared_ptr<gmxapi::MDModule> module)
 *      {
 *          auto runner = impl_->getRunner();
 *          auto restraint = module->getRestraint();
 *          runner->addPullPotential(restraint, module->name());
 *      }
