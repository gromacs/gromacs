/*! \ingroup gmxapi
 * \file
 * \brief Provide forward declarations for symbols in the GROMACS public headers.
 *
 * Basic API clients only need to compile
 * and link against the gmxapi target, but some gmxapi classes use opaque pointers to
 * library classes that are forward-declared here.
 * Client code should not need to include this header directly.
 *
 * For maximal compatibility with other libgmxapi clients (such as third-party
 * Python modules), client code should use the wrappers and protocols in the
 * gmxapi.h header.
 *
 * Note that there is a separate CMake target to build the full
 * developer documentation for gmxapi.
 * Refer to GMXAPI developer docs for the protocols that map gmxapi interfaces to
 * GROMACS library interfaces.
 * Refer to the GROMACS developer
 * documentation for details on library interfaces forward-declared in this header.
 *
 * \todo Improve documentation cross-linking.
