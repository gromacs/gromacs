 * Manages signals for a single gmx::Mdrunner. Currently only supports a stop signal that

 * the associated runner. This is not what we want in the long run.
 * \todo This class should handle signal inputs to operations that take signals as input (like
 * Mdrunner) and \todo should allow multiple subscribers. For additional signal processing, such as
 * boolean operations, additional operations should be inserted in a chain.
 *
 * SignalManager objects are created during Session launch and are owned exclusively by session
 * implementation objects. If Session::isOpen() is true, the SignalManager should still be valid,
 * but the intended use case is that SignalManager handles should be retrieved immediately before
 * use by implementation code within the library with SessionImpl::getSignalManager().
 *
 * A SignalManager should be created for each signal consumer (each gmx::Mdrunner) in a Session.
 * This occurs in the SessionImpl::create() function.
