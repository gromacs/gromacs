====================
Model and Microstate
====================

Provide API tools for molecular model and microstate data before, during, and after simulation.

* library-level managed access to state data for plugins
* API handle objects to allow data transfer optimizations across API calls
* data exchange conventions for external software
* atom typing and force field conventions
* Gromacs thermodynamics and physics calculations
