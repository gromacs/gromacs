 * declared in headers depend on this being consistently defined.
 * But thread-MPI itself does not include gmxpre.h, so the same define is also
 * set in config.h (which gets included by thread-MPI, but only in the source
 * files). There are some other config.h defines that appear in thread-MPI
 * headers, but currently GROMACS does not use any code that would depend on
