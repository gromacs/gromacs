************************************************************

fftpack.c is copy of fftpack from Numpy with very minor modifications:
  - usage of fftpack.h (replacement for Treal define)
  - [cr]fft[ifb]1 non-static
  - Added Copyright headers
  - Added fftpack_ prefix

fftpack.h is GROMACS specific

Original version is from Numpy 1.6
