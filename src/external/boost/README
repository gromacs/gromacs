Steps to produce minimal version of BOOST:
1) Download Boost (current minimal version is derived from 1.55.0)
2) Extract
3) Edit Boost files to uncomment unnessary includes and insert warning-suppression pragmas
   (search for GMX in minimal version and copy all changes)
   Alternative make a patch by diffing against unmodified version and applying patch. Such as
   diff /path/to/boost_1_55_0 . -rwu |grep -v ^"Only in" > patch && patch -p? < patch
4) Make sure our subset works even with compilers not listed
   among the boost ones (in particular, Fujistu in native mode):
   - Edit config/select_compiler_config.hpp to add the fallback
     to a generic compiler capability file at the end.
   - Add the generic compiler capability file config/compiler/generic.hpp
5) run bcp with required files (currently boost/exception/all.hpp boost/scoped_ptr.hpp)
6) delete source files which are not required. Currently:
   - libs/smart_ptr/
   - libs/exception/
   Make sure that they are really not needed. If any source files are added make sure to add them to cmake.
