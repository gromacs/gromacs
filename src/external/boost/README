Steps to produce minimal version of BOOST:
1) Download Boost (current minimal version is derived from 1.55.0)
2) Extract
3) Edit Boost files to uncomment unnessary includes (search for GMX in minimal version and copy all changes)
4) Make sure our subset works even with compilers not listed
   among the boost ones (in particular, Fujistu in native mode):
   - Edit config/select_compiler_config.hpp to add the fallback
     to a generic compiler capability file at the end.
   - Add the generic compiler capability file config/compiler/generic.hpp
5) run bcp with required files (currently exception/all.hpp, scoped_ptr.hpp)
6) delete source files which are not required. Currently:
   - libs/smart_ptr/src/sp_collector.cpp
   - libs/smart_ptr/src/sp_debug_hooks.cpp
   Make sure that they are really not needed.If any source files are added make sure to add them to cmake.
