Steps to produce minimal version of BOOST:
1) Download Boost (current minimal version is derived from 1.55.0)
2) Extract
3) Edit Boost files to uncomment unnessary includes (search for GMX in minimal version and copy all changes)
4) run bcp with required files (currently exception/all.hpp, scoped_ptr.hpp)
5) delete source files which are not required. Currently:
 	libs/smart_ptr/src/sp_collector.cpp
	libs/smart_ptr/src/sp_debug_hooks.cpp
   Make sure that they are really not needed.If any source files are added make sure to add them to cmake.
