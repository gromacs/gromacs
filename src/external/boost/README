Steps to produce minimal version of BOOST:
1) Download Boost (current minimal version is derived from 1.48.0)
2) Extract
3) Edit Boost files to uncomment unnessary includes (search for GMX in minimal version and copy all changes)
4) run bcp with required files (currently exception/all.hpp, scoped_ptr.hpp)
5) delete source files which are not required. Currently:
        libs/exception/src/clone_current_exception_non_intrusive.cpp
 	libs/smart_ptr/src/sp_collector.cpp
	libs/smart_ptr/src/sp_debug_hooks.cpp
   Make sure that they are really not needed and that activating the feature they implement gives a compiler
   not linker error (by adding an appropriate #error directive). If any source files are added make sure 
   to add them to cmake.
6) Check that boost/exception/detail/error_info_impl.hpp has virtual
   destructors to avoid compiler warnings.
