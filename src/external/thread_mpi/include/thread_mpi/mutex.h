/*! \brief A lock guard class that allows for the simple management of
           mutexes. C++11 compatible.

    In C++, mutexes would normally have to be unlocked with explicit
    exception handlers and unlock statements. This class automates that
    by handling the mutex unlock in a destructor. The constructor locks
    the mutex.

    Usage example:
    tMPI::mutex mtx;
    void do_count()
    {
        tMPI::lock_guard<tMPI::mutex> lock(mtx);
        count += 1;
    }
