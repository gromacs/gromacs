--------------
The clFFT library is an open source OpenCL library
implementation of discrete Fast Fourier Transforms. It:

* Provides a fast and accurate platform for calculating
  discrete FFTs
* Supports 1D, 2D, and 3D transforms with a batch size
  that can be greater than 1
* Supports complex and real transforms
* Supports planar (real and complex components in
  separate arrays) and interleaved (real and complex
  components as a pair contiguous in memory) formats
* Supports dimension lengths that can be any mix of
  powers of 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13
* Supports single and double precision floating-point
  formats
* Supports in-place or out-of-place transforms


clFFT - Release Notes - version 2.12.2
--------------------------------------

This is a patch update release to v2.12.1.
It has the following:

* Fix for thread safety issues
* Fix for failures in certain 2D transforms
* Fix for failures on POCL runtime
* Other minor improvements

Details on issues available on GitHub.


clFFT - Release Notes - version 2.12.1
--------------------------------------

New features of this release:

* Fixes for bugs in decomposition logic of very large problem sizes
  with environment flag CLFFT_REQUEST_LIB_NOMEMALLOC=1
* Validation of sizes that are powers of 2,3,5 and combinations
  thereof upto maximum size close to 25GB on S9170

Driver notes:

* This library version has been tested with Catalyst
  Pro driver version 15.302 on Firepro W9100 & S9170.


clFFT - Release Notes - version 2.12.0
--------------------------------------

New features of this release:

* Addition of radix 11 & 13 enables support for powers of 11 & 13 size
  transforms
* Support for 1D large size transforms with no extra memory allocation
  requirement with environment flag CLFFT_REQUEST_LIB_NOMEMALLOC=1
  for complex FFTs of powers of 3,5,10 sizes. Note that support for
  power-of-2 size has been available since version 2.10.

Driver notes:

* This library version has been tested with Catalyst
  Pro driver version 15.201 on Firepro W9100.


clFFT - Release Notes - version 2.10.2
--------------------------------------

This is a patch update release to v2.10.1.
It has the following:

* Fixes for accuracy/stability issues noted in large size real FFTs


clFFT - Release Notes - version 2.10.1
--------------------------------------

This is a patch update release to v2.10.0.
It has the following:

* Performance fixes for slowdown observed vs v2.8. Specifically,
  2D transforms for certain sizes showed significant slowdown.
  This issue has been fixed in this release. The fix also makes the
  performance in general better than v2.8.
* Code reorganization in transposes and performance improvements.
  There is a modest performance improvement with inplace transforms
  for large power-of-2 sizes.
* Several minor enhancements and bug fixes 


clFFT - Release Notes - version 2.10.0
--------------------------------------

New features of this release:

* Post-callback feature that enables custom post-processing
  of output data directly by the library with user callback function
* Support for in-place transposes for power-of-2 sizes enables really
  large 1D transforms as well as supporting no additional memory
  allocation, by library, for a range of problem sizes


clFFT - Release Notes - version 2.8.0
--------------------------------------

New features of this release:

* Support for power-of-7 size transforms
* Pre-callback feature that enables custom pre-processing
  of input data directly by the library with user callback function
* Support for 1D large size transforms with no extra memory allocation
  requirement for certain sizes

Driver notes:

* This library version has been tested with Catalyst
  Pro driver version 14.502 on Firepro W9100.


clFFT - Release Notes - version 2.6.1
--------------------------------------

This is a patch update release to v2.6.0. It has the following.

* Fix for client application crash with Linux 14.502 driver
* Performance fixes for real forward and backward transform when
  enabling ECC
* Performance fixes for complex transforms over a small range in
  power-of-2 sizes
* Improvement in API timing in client
* Several minor enhancements and bug fixes

Driver notes:

* This library version has been tested with Catalyst
  Pro driver version 14.502 on Firepro W9100.

* Significant uplift of 1D real forward transform
  performance for power-of-2 sizes
* Significant uplift of large 2D/3D real transform
  performance for power-of-2 sizes

Known issues:

* Size limit on 1D real transforms remain at 2^24
  for single precision and 2^22 for double
  precision

Driver notes:

* This library version has been tested with Catalyst
  Pro driver version 14.301 on Firepro W9100.


clFFT - Release Notes - version 2.4.0
--------------------------------------

New features of this release:

* Significant uplift of 1D complex transform performance
* 1D large size limit relaxation for complex transforms
