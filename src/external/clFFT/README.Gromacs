This directory contains source code for clFFT library.

The code has been copied verbatim from the source distribution for clFFT 
(https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clFFT) master branch commit c59712e (on Aug 11, 2017),
which is derived from clFFT release 2.12.2,

by copying the following files/directories recursively:

LICENSE
NOTICE
ReleaseNotes.txt
src/include/
src/library/
src/statTimer/
src/clFFTConfig.cmake.in
src/clFFTConfigVersion.cmake.in
src/CMakeLists.txt

The file src/CMakeLists.txt is part of the GROMACS build system and
has been written from scratch to produce a static build of clFFT.

The GROMACS top-level cmake/FindclFFT.cmake has been written to
conform to modern CMake standards and provide a simple implementation
of our default behaviour to link to external clFFT if it is found.
The version of this file from the git repo has been omitted.

The file src/include/clFFT.version.h is copied from src/include/clFFT.version.h.in,
substituting the version number placeholders with version 2.14.0
(as in the original build script), and defining a static build option.

To compile everything as C++ the src/library/md5sum.c is renamed to cpp and
the extern "C" is removed from src/library/fft_binary_lookup.cpp.
