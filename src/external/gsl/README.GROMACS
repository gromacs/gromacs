Microsft Guidelines Support Library (GSL) was imported from commmit
9d13cb14c3 of https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL.git.

Various dotfiles and the tests directory have been omitted,
particularly because the tests also require the MS unittests package
to work.

span, string_span, gsl_byte and gsl_util were modified to get them to
compile with GROMACS. multi_span and gsl_algorithm are unmodified.
Three kinds of changes were made:
* commenting out constexpr for functions that cannot be constexpr
  with C++11 compilers, e.g. because there is a variable declaration
  or assignment
* various std:: helper types from recent versions of the C++ standards
  are declared in gsl::details:: namespace (adding to std namespace is
  unwise) in gsl_detail_types, and usages adapted accordingly
* work-arounds for MSVC versions that GROMACS does not support were
  removed
