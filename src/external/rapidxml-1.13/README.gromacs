This is the tarball from RapidXml version 1.13. It is unmodified,
except as described below.

rapidxml_print.hpp is modified to make template member declarations
for print_* functions before the definition of print_node, which uses
them. This keeps clang-3.5 happy (and doubtless other compilers also).
