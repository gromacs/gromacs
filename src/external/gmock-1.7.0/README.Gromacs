This directory contains source code for Google C++ Testing and Mocking
Frameworks.

The code has been copied verbatim from the source distribution for GMock 1.7.0
by copying the following files/directories recursively, excluding *.pump files:
gmock-1.7.0/LICENSE
gmock-1.7.0/README
gmock-1.7.0/include/
gmock-1.7.0/src/
gmock-1.7.0/gtest/LICENSE
gmock-1.7.0/gtest/README
gmock-1.7.0/gtest/include/
gmock-1.7.0/gtest/src/

The file CMakeLists.txt in this directory is part of the Gromacs build system
and has been written from scratch.

In the default version, gmock-1.7.0 assumes wcscasecmp() to be present on Linux.
This is not the case on all platforms, so on line 1610 of gtest/src/gtest.cc
we have added a define to only use this if GTEST_HAS_WCSCASECMP is set. Since
we never set this define, we fall back on the alternative internal implementation
which should be perfectly fine for now.

gmock-1.7.0 also assumes that streaming results to a socket is
something you can always do on Linux, but the implementation uses
getaddrinfo(), about which the Cray linker warns because its use would
require shared libraries at run time. Since Gromacs testing doesn't
use this feature, we'd just want to turn it off, but there's no
interface for that. So, GTEST_CAN_STREAM_RESULTS is added in
gtest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h to allow the default
behaviour to be applied only if the user hasn't gotten involved.

We also apply the patch found at
https://github.com/google/googletest/issues/705#issuecomment-235067917
to fix a segfault with gcc6 arising from gmock's erroneous use of
undefined behaviour (see Redmine #1911).
