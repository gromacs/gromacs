This directory contains source code for Google C++ Testing and Mocking
Frameworks.

The code has been copied verbatim from the source distribution for GMock 1.7.0
by copying the following files/directories recursively, excluding *.pump files:
gmock-1.7.0/LICENSE
gmock-1.7.0/README
gmock-1.7.0/include/
gmock-1.7.0/src/
gmock-1.7.0/gtest/LICENSE
gmock-1.7.0/gtest/README
gmock-1.7.0/gtest/include/
gmock-1.7.0/gtest/src/

On the very first line of gmock-1.7.0/gtest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h
we have added the define to use the built-in version of TR1 tuple.

The file CMakeLists.txt in this directory is part of the Gromacs build system
and has been written from scratch.
