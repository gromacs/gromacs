/*! \brief
 * Levenberg-Marquardt minimization.
 *
 *   This routine contains the core algorithm of our library.
 *
 *   It minimizes the sum of the squares of m nonlinear functions
 *   in n variables by a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
 *   The function evaluation is done by the user-provided routine 'evaluate'.
 *   The Jacobian is then calculated by a forward-difference approximation.
 *
 *   Parameters:
 *
 * \param[in] n_par The number of variables (INPUT, positive integer).
 * \param par The parameters to be fitted
 *      x is the solution vector (INPUT/OUTPUT, array of length n).
 *        On input it must be set to an estimated solution.
 *        On output it yields the final estimate of the solution.
 *
 *      m is the number of functions to be minimized (INPUT, positive integer).
 *        It must fulfill m>=n.
 *
 *      data is a pointer that is ignored by lmmin; it is however forwarded
 *        to the user-supplied functions evaluate and printout.
 *        In a typical application, it contains experimental data to be fitted.
 *
 *      evaluate is a user-supplied function that calculates the m functions.
 *        Parameters:
 *          n, x, m, data as above.
 *          fvec is an array of length m; on OUTPUT, it must contain the
 *            m function values for the parameter vector x.
 *          userbreak is an integer pointer. When *userbreak is set to a
 *            nonzero value, lmmin will terminate.
 *
 *      control contains INPUT variables that control the fit algorithm,
 *        as declared and explained in lmstruct.h
 *
 *      status contains OUTPUT variables that inform about the fit result,
 *        as declared and explained in lmstruct.h
