This directory contains only the barebones version of the
lmfit package, version 7.0. Full version is available from
http://apps.jcns.fz-juelich.de/doku/sc/lmfit

The license under which lmfit is bundled may be found in the GROMACS
root directory in file COPYING.

This version contains minor modifications
* to convert to C++,
* to declare functions not used outside lmfit.cpp as static,
* to remove some dead code, and
* to introduce some explicit pointer casts to pacify compilers.
