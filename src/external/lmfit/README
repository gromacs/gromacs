This directory contains only the barebones version of the
lmfit package, version 9.0. Full version is available from
https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/mlz/lmfit/

The license under which lmfit is bundled may be found in the GROMACS
root directory in file COPYING.

This version contains minor modifications
* to convert to C++,
* to declare functions not used outside lmfit.cpp as static,
* to remove/disable some dead code (error estimate), and
* to introduce some explicit pointer casts to pacify compilers.
