This directory contains source code for Google C++ Testing and Mocking
Frameworks.

The code has been copied nearly verbatim from the GoogleTest 1.8.0
tarball by copying the following files/directories recursively:

README.md
googletest
googlemock

However, the following files/subdirectories were excluded because they
are unneeded for GROMACS:

*.pump
travis.h
appveyor.yml
build-aux
cmake
codegear
configure.ac
Makefile.am
msvc
m4
xcode
test
scripts
googletest/docs/V*md
googletest/samples
googlemock/docs/v*/*md

The file CMakeLists.txt in this directory is part of the GROMACS build
system and has been written from scratch.

This README.Gromacs file is new, of course.

In the default version, googletest-1.8.0 assumes wcscasecmp() to be
present on Linux.  This is not the case on all platforms, so in
gtest/src/gtest.cc we have added a define to only use this if
GTEST_HAS_WCSCASECMP is set. Since we never set this define, we fall
back on the alternative internal implementation which should be
perfectly fine for now.

googletest-1.8.0 also assumes that streaming results to a socket is
something you can always do on Linux, but the implementation uses
getaddrinfo(), about which the Cray linker warns because its use would
require shared libraries at run time. Since GROMACS testing doesn't
use this feature, we'd just want to turn it off, but there's no
interface for that. So, GTEST_CAN_STREAM_RESULTS is added in
googletest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h to allow the default
behaviour to be applied only if the user hasn't gotten involved.

Two helper functions for implementing INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P in
gtest-param-test.h have had the static specifer added to their
declarations, which silences -Wmissing-prototype warnings.
