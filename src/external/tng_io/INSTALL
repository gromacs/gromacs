mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make


Test by running:
bin/tng_testing

Make a system-wide installation by:
make install
(this will require administrative privileges on most systems, i.e. 'sudo make install'
on a Unix like system with a sudoers file)


Useful cmake flags:
-DTNG_BUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON to build the API documentation (requires doxygen)
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to compile with debug flags (recommended for
feedback during development)
-DTNG_BUILD_FORTRAN=ON to build the Fortran MD simulations example, saving results
in the TNG format (requires a Fortran compiler allowing cray-pointers).
