## Unit Testing Suite for SZ
# Author: Sheng Di

Use Makefile.bk to do the compilation, such as "make -f Makefile.bk". 
You need to compile SZ first, before compiling the CUnit-testing codes. 
Before executing "make -f Makefile.bk", please modify the SZPATH and CUnit_HOME in the Makefile.bk based on the setting of your local machine.

Convert CUnit to JUnit for fitting Jenkin CI:
