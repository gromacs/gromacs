#The high values of max_quant_intervals, the lower compression speed, but the higher ability the compressor can reach high compression ratios for high-precision compression.
#As for low-precision compression (i.e., high error bound such as 1E-2), max_quant_intervals could be set to 256 or 65536.

#errorBoundMode: 8 options to control different types of error bounds (detailed can be found in the user guide)
#ABS_AND_REL, ABS_OR_REL, ABS, REL (or VR_REL), PW_REL, ABS_AND_PW_REL, ABS_OR_PW_REL, REL_AND_PW_REL, REL_OR_PW_REL

#errorBoundMode = PSNR
#errorBoundMode = ABS
#errorBoundMode = PW_REL
#errorBoundMode = NORM

#absolute Error Bound (NOTE: it's valid when errorBoundMode is related to ABS (i.e., absolute error bound)
#absErrBound is to limit the (de)compression errors to be within an absolute error. For example, absErrBound=0.0001 means the decompressed value must be in [V-0.0001,V+0.0001], where V is the original true value.
#absErrBound = 1E-4
#absErrBound = 0.0000000001
#absErrBound = 1E-3
absErrBound = 4E-7

#relative Bound Ratio (NOTE: it's valid only when errorBoundMode is related to REL (i.e., value_range based relative error bound)
#relErrBound is to limit the (de)compression errors by considering the global data value range size (i.e., taking into account the range size (max_value - min_value)).
#For example, suppose relBoundRatio is set to 0.01, and the data set is {100,101,102,103,104,...,110}, so the global value range size is 110-100=10, so the error bound will actually be 10*0.01=0.1, from the perspective of "relBoundRatio"

#psnr is to spesify the PSNR of the compression. It's valid only when errorBoundMode == PSNR

normErr = 0.05

#point-wise relative Bound Ratio (NOTE: only valid when errorBoundMode is related to PW_REL)
#pw_relBountRatio is to limit the (de)compression errors by considering the point-wise original data values.
#For example, suppose pw_relBoundRatio is set to 0.01, and the data set is {100,101,102,103,104,...,110}, so the compression errors will be limited to {1,1.01,1.02,....1.10} for the data points.
#Only valid when errorBoundMode = PW_REL
