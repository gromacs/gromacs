/*
  About the values for rdwarf and rgiant.

  The original values, both in single-precision FORTRAN source code and in double-precision code were:
#define rdwarf 3.834e-20
#define rgiant 1.304e19
  See for example:
    http://www.netlib.org/slatec/src/denorm.f
    http://www.netlib.org/slatec/src/enorm.f
  However, rdwarf is smaller than sqrt(FLT_MIN) = 1.0842021724855044e-19, so that rdwarf**2 will
  underflow. This contradicts the constraints expressed in the comments below.

  We changed these constants to those proposed by the
  implementation found in MPFIT http://cow.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/fitting.html

 cmpfit-1.2 proposes the following definitions:
  rdwarf = sqrt(dpmpar(2)*1.5) * 10
  rgiant = sqrt(dpmpar(3)) * 0.1

 The half version does not really worked that way, so we use for half:
  rdwarf = sqrt(dpmpar(2)) * 2
  rgiant = sqrt(dpmpar(3)) * 0.5
 Any suggestion is welcome. Half CMINPACK is really only a
 proof-of-concept anyway.

 See the example/tenorm*c, which computes these values
