/*! \brief Initialize parallel MPI-based 3D-FFT.
 *
 *  This routine performs real-to-complex and complex-to-real parallel 3D FFTs,

 *  PPPM algorithms, and do allocate extra workspace whenever it might improve
 *  performance. 
 *

 *                        allocated or with automatic storage.
 *  \param ngridx         Global number of grid cells in the x direction. Must be
 *                        divisible by the number of nodes.
 *  \param ngridy         Global number of grid cells in the y direction. Must be
 *                        divisible by the number of nodes.
 *  \param ngridz         Global number of grid cells in the z direction.
 *  \param node2slab      Node id to slab index array, can be NULL.
 *  \param slab2grid_x    Slab index to grid_x array (nnodes+1), can be NULL.
 *  \param comm           MPI communicator, must have been initialized. 
 *  \param bReproducible  Try to avoid FFT timing optimizations and other stuff
 *                        that could make results differ for two runs with
 *                        identical input (reproducibility for debugging).

 *  Direction is either GMX_FFT_REAL_TO_COMPLEX or GMX_FFT_COMPLEX_TO_REAL.

 *  If input and output arrays are separate there is no packing to consider.
 *  Input is simply nx*ny*nz in real, and output ny*nx*nzc in complex.
 *
 *  In they are identical we need to make sure there is room for the complex
