   GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e.  simulate
   the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds, to millions
   of particles.

   Currently, there is documentation available (at least) on the following
   parts of the source tree:
   - \subpage thread_mpi
   - \subpage libtrajana
