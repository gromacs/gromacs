/** @file gmx_sort.h

 *  @brief Portable implementation of thread-safe sort routines.
 *
 *
 *  This module provides a Gromacs version of the qsort() routine defined.
 *  It is not highly optimized, but it is thread safe, i.e. multiple threads
 *  can simultaneously call gmx_qsort with different data.
