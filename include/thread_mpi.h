If you want to redistribute modifications, please consider that
scientific software is very special. Version control is crucial -
bugs must be traceable. We will be happy to consider code for
inclusion in the official distribution, but derived work should not
be called official thread_mpi. Details are found in the README & COPYING
files.

To help us fund development, we humbly ask that you cite
any papers on the package - you can find them in the top README file.
