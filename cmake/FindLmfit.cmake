# This package tries to find an external lmfit library, version
# 7. Note that pkg-config support was removed before version 7, so is
# no longer supported here. Upon exit, the following variables may be
# set:
#
# LMFIT_FOUND       - lmfit was found
# LMFIT_INCLUDE_DIR - lmfit include directory
# LMFIT_LIBRARY     - lmfit library
# LMFIT_LINKS_OK    - lmfit libraries link correctly
# LMFIT_VERSION     - lmfit version string as "major.minor"
#
# CMake will search the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH in the usual way, but if you
# need more control then setting LMFIT_INCLUDE_DIR and LMFIT_LIBRARY
# on the cmake command line to suitable values will work.
