# - Find Intel TBB
#
# Usage: find_package(TBB [QUIET] [REQUIRED])
#
# In addition to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH and default system locations, we also
# look in the usual locations for the commercial TBB version in /opt.
# It is also possible to set TBB_ROOT separately to indicate the location.
#
# For default usage, you probably want to add both TBB_LIBRARIES and
# TBB_MALLOC_LIBRARIES to your link lines, but they are separate variables
# in case you have an even better allocator. Read the TBB documentation for
# information about when/how to use the proxy library.
#
# FindTBB defines the following variables:
#
#  TBB_FOUND                          True if headers and libraries were located
#  TBB_INCLUDE_DIRS                   Where to find TBB headers
#  TBB_LIBRARIES                      The main TBB libraries
#  TBB_MALLOC_LIBRARIES               TBB malloc libraries
#  TBB_MALLOC_PROXY_LIBRARIES         TBB malloc proxy libraries
#  TBB_VERSION                        Overall tbb version (major.minor)
#  TBB_VERSION_MAJOR                  Major Product Version Number
#  TBB_VERSION_MINOR                  Minor Product Version Number
#  TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION              Engineering Focused Version Number
#  TBB_COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_VERSION   The oldest major interface version
#                                     still supported. This uses the engineering
#                                     focused interface version numbers.
#
#  Note: You can inspect the library variables to check of the malloc or
#  malloc proxy library was found, but this should typically not be critical.
#  All that happens without them is that you use the default allocator,
#  and if you don't have the libraries that is what you will have to do anyway.
