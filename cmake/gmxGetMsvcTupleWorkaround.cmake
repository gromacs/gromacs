# GMock uses tuples extensively, and MSVC bundles a tuple library that
# is not compatible with the standard. r675 of googletest works around
# this properly, but that's not in GMock 1.7.0. That logic is
# duplicated here. See
# https://code.google.com/p/googletest/source/detail?r=675#, but note
# that its summary does not represent its code correctly.
#
# This function should be called to get the compile definitions
# suitable for working around MSVC to compile GMock, if any.
# Returns a string of options in VARIABLE
