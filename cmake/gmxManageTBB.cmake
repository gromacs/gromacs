    # We do not yet have any TBB code that absolutely needs the library, but
    # at the same time we want to test that it works on all platforms. We solve
    # this by accepting if it is not present, so we can enable it by default
    # and find potential bugs with the basic headers and linking.
    # Once we start actually using TBB we should add a longer explanation
    # below if the library is not found, and issue a fatal error.
