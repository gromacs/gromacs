# This package tries to find the TinyXML-2 library. It will consider

# following variables may be set:
#
# TinyXML2_FOUND       - TinyXML-2 was found
# TinyXML2_INCLUDE_DIR - TinyXML-2 include directory
# TinyXML2_LIBRARIES   - TinyXML-2 libraries
# TinyXML2_LINKS_OK    - TinyXML-2 libraries link correctly
# TinyXML2_VERSION     - TinyXML-2 version string as "major.minor"
