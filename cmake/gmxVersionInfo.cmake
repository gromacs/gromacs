# Sets version information variables and provides CMake functions for
# generating files based on them
#
# This script provides the following basic version variables that need to be
# maintained manually:
#   GMX_VERSION_MAJOR      Major version number.
#   GMX_VERSION_MINOR      Minor version number.
#   GMX_VERSION_PATCH      Patch version number.
#       Should always be defined: zero for, e.g., 5.0.
#   GMX_VERSION_SUFFIX     String suffix to add to numeric version string.
#       "-dev" is automatically added when not building from a source package,
#       and does not need to be kept here. This mechanism is not quite enough
#       for building a tarball, but setting the CMake cache variable
#       GMX_BUILD_TARBALL=on will suppress the addition of "-dev" to the
#       version string.
#   LIBRARY_SOVERSION_MAJOR so major version for the built libraries.
#       Should be increased for each binary incompatible release. In GROMACS,
#       the typical policy is to increase it at the start of the development
#       cycle for each major/minor version change, but not for patch releases,
#       even if the latter may not always be fully binary compatible.
#       Table of historical values
#         GROMACS     5.0    0
#         GROMACS     5.1    1
#   LIBRARY_SOVERSION_MINOR so minor version for the built libraries.
#       Should be increased for each release that changes only the implementation.
#       In GROMACS, the typical policy is to increase it for each patch version
#       change, even if they may not always be fully binary compatible.
#       If it is somehow clear that the ABI implementation has not changed
#       in a patch release, this variable should not increase. Release candidate
#       and beta versions will not increase this number, since nobody should
#       write code against such versions.
#   LIBRARY_VERSION        Full library version.
#   REGRESSIONTEST_BRANCH  For builds not from source packages, name of the
#       regressiontests branch at gerrit.gromacs.org whose HEAD can test this
#       code, *if* this code is recent enough (i.e., contains all changes from
#       the corresponding code branch that affects the regression test
#       results). Even after a release branch is forked for the source
#       repository, the correct regressiontests branch can still be master,
#       because we do not fork it until behaviour needs to change.
#   REGRESSIONTEST_MD5SUM
#       The MD5 checksum of the regressiontest tarball. Only used when building
#       from a source package.
# They are collected into a single section below.
# The following variables are set based on these:
#   GMX_VERSION            String composed from GMX_VERSION_* numeric variables
#       above. Example: 4.6.1, 5.0
#   GMX_VERSION_STRING     String with GMX_VERSION suffixed with the given
#       suffix and possibly "-dev" for builds not from a source package.
#   GMX_VERSION_NUMERIC    Numeric version number (e.g., 40601 for 4.6.1).
#   GMX_API_VERSION        Numeric API version.
#       This is currently set automatically to GMX_VERSION_NUMERIC, but may
#       become manually maintained in the future if there will be releases
#       where the API does not change, but programs/libraries do.
#       In such a case, this should be the first version where the current API
#       appeared.
#   REGRESSIONTEST_VERSION For source packages, version number of the
#       matching regressiontests tarball.  Not used for builds not from source
#       packages.
# The latter two are used to generate gromacs/version.h to allow software
# written against the GROMACS API to provide some #ifdef'ed code to support
# multiple GROMACS versions.
#
# The following variables are defined without manual intervention:
#   SOURCE_IS_SOURCE_DISTRIBUTION  The source tree is from a source tarball.
#   SOURCE_IS_GIT_REPOSITORY       The source tree is a git repository.
# Note that both can be false if the tree has been extracted, e.g., as a
# tarball directly from git.
# Additionally, the following variable is defined:
#   BUILD_IS_INSOURCE              The build is happening in-source.
#
# This script also declares machinery to generate and obtain version
# information from a git repository.  This is enabled by default if the source
# tree is a git, but can be disabled with
#   GMX_GIT_VERSION_INFO           Advanced CMake variable to disable git
#                                  version info generation.
# The main interface to this machinery is the gmx_configure_version_file()
# CMake function.  The signature is
#   gmx_configure_version_file(<input> <output>
#                              [REMOTE_HASH] [SOURCE_FILE]
#                              [TARGET <target>]
#                              [COMMENT <comment>])
#   <input>      Specify the input and output files as for configure_file().
#   <output>     The configuration is done with configure_file(... @ONLY) with
#                the following variables defined (as well as all the
#                GMX_VERSION* variables from above):
#                  GMX_VERSION_STRING_FULL
#                  GMX_VERSION_FULL_HASH
#                  GMX_VERSION_CENTRAL_BASE_HASH
#                The output file is created during build time, so any dependent
#                targets should specify it as a dependency.
#   REMOTE_HASH  Currently, this has no effect, but it signifies that the
#                <input> file is using the CENTRAL_BASE_HASH variable.
#                This variable is much more expensive to initialize than the
#                others, so this allows local changes in this file to only
#                compute that value when required if that becomes necessary.
#   SOURCE_FILE  Signals that <output> will be used as a source file.
#                The function will set properties for the source file
#                appropriately to signify that it is generated.
#   TARGET       By default, this function uses add_custom_command() to
#                generate the output file.  If TARGET is specified, then
#                add_custom_target() is used to create a target with the given
#                name <target> that runs this custom command.  Use this if
#                the same file will be used for multiple downstream targets,
#                or if the explicit target for the file is otherwise
#                necessary.
#   COMMENT      Set a custom comment to be shown when building the rule
#                (see add_custom_command(... COMMENT <comment>)).
# As an alternative to using this script, also the following variables are
# provided (can be useful when generating more complex CMake scripts that do
# build-time tasks):
#   VERSION_INFO_CMAKE_SCRIPT
#       Absolute path to a CMake script that can be included using include()
#       to declare the GMX_VERSION_* variables documented for
#       gmx_configure_version_file().
#   VERSION_INFO_DEPS
#       If a custom command depends on VERSION_INFO_CMAKE_SCRIPT, then it
#       should add ${VERSION_INFO_DEPS} to its DEPENDS list to get the
#       appropriate dependencies.
# TODO: If someone wants to add a custom target that depends on
# VERSION_INFO_CMAKE_SCRIPT, a separate variable may be needed for those
# dependencies.
#
# The version string printed by 'gmx -version' (and also printed in the startup
# header) can provide useful information for, e.g., diagnosing bug reports and
# identifying what exact version the user was using.  The following formats are
# possible (with examples given for a particular version):
#   4.6.1       Plain version number without any suffix signifies a build from
#               a released source tarball.
#   4.6.1-dev   '-dev' suffix signifies all other builds. If there is no other
#               information, either the user built the code outside any git
#               repository, or disabled the version info generation.
#   4.6.1-dev-YYYYMMDD-1234abc
#               The YYYYMMDD part shows the commit date (not author date) of
#               the HEAD commit from which the code was built.  The abbreviated
#               hash is the hash of that commit (the full hash is available in
#               'gmx -version' output).
#               If the HEAD hash is not identified as coming from branches in
#               "authoritative" GROMACS repositories, 'gmx -version' will show
#               the nearest ancestor commit that is identified as such (but see
#               the '-local' and '-unknown' suffixes below).
#   4.6.1-dev-YYYYMMDD-1234abc-dirty
#               As above, but there were local modifications in the source tree
#               when the code was built.
#   4.6.1-dev-YYYYMMDD-1234abc-unknown
#               As above, but there were no remotes in the repository that
#               could be identified as "authoritative" GROMACS repositories.
#               This happens if the code is not cloned from git.gromacs.org
#               or gerrit.gromacs.org.
#   4.6.1-dev-YYYYMMDD-1234abc-local
#               As above, but there were no commits in the recent history of
#               the branch that could be identified as coming from
#               "authoritative" GROMACS repositories.  This should be
#               relatively rare.
#
# Other variables set here are not intended for use outside this file.
# The scripts gmxGenerateVersionInfo.cmake and gmxConfigureVersionInfo.cmake
# are used internally by this machinery, as well as VersionInfo.cmake.cmakein.

#   2. (build time)     VersionInfo-partial.cmake.cmakein -> VersionInfo.cmake
#        - Set variables that may change as result of repository state changes
#          (i.e., everything that requires running git).
#        - Runs every time as a git-version-info target, but the output file
#          timestamp only changes if its contents actually change.
#        - Depending on the native build system, this may run once per build
#          or once per each time it is required for step 3.
#   3. (build time)     VersionInfo.cmake -> other files
#        - Set variables in files specified with gmx_configure_version_file()
#          using the values generated in step 2.
#        - Each file runs as a custom command that depends on the previous
#          steps, and runs only if the VersionInfo.cmake file is newer than the
#          output file.
# Without git info, the sequence is:
#  1. (configure time) VersionInfo.cmake.cmakein -> VersionInfo.cmake
#        - Everything is known at configure time, so the output is generated
#          immediately with all variables set (git info will be empty).
#  2. (build time)     VersionInfo.cmake -> other files
#        - As with git info, processes files from gmx_configure_version_file().
