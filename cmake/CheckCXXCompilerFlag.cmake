# - Check whether the CXX compiler supports a given flag.
# CHECK_CXX_COMPILER_FLAG(<flag> <var>)
#  <flag> - the compiler flag
#  <var>  - variable to store the result
# This internally calls the check_cxx_source_compiles macro.  See help
# for CheckCXXSourceCompiles for a listing of variables that can
# modify the build.
