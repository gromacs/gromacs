# This CMakeLists.txt allows source distributions of the gmxapi Python package
# to rely on scikit-build for support of various Python packaging systems. The
# simplest use case is to allow the `setup.py` file to invoke skbuild to
# configure and run CMake. CMake could be invoked directly by the user or a
# parent package, but the Python distribution would not be packaged automatically.
