gmxapi version and release information.

The ``gmxapi.__version__`` attribute contains a :pep:`version string <440>`.
The more general way to access the package version is with the
:py:mod:`pkg_resources <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html>` module::

    pkg_resources.get_distribution('gmxapi').version

`gmxapi.version` module functions `api_is_at_least()` and `has_feature()`
support additional convenience and introspection.

.. versionchanged:: 0.2

    This module no longer provides public data attributes.
    Instead, use the module functions or
    :py:mod:`packaging.version <https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version/>`.

.. seealso::

    Consider https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version/ for programmatic
    handling of the version string. For example::

        from packaging.version import parse
        gmxapi_version = pkg_resources.get_distribution('gmxapi').version
        if parse(gmxapi_version).is_prerelease:
            print('The early bird gets the worm.')

.. todo:: Use pkg_resources.get_distribution('gmxapi').version and
          "development installations" instead of relying on or publicizing
          a __version__ attribute.

# fr7: Python bindings for launching simulations
# fr8: gmx.mdrun understands ensemble work

# fr14: Easy access to GROMACS run time parameters
# fr15: Simulation input modification
# fr16: Create simulation input from simulation output

# fr18: GROMACS CLI tools receive improved Python-level support over generic commandline_operations
# fr19: GROMACS CLI tools receive improved C++-level support over generic commandline_operations

    """Query whether a named feature is available in the installed package.

    Between updates to the API specification, new features or experimental aspects
    may be introduced into the package and need to be detectable. This function
    is intended to facilitate code testing and resolving differences between
    development branches. Users should refer to the documentation for the package
    modules and API level.

    The primary use case is, in conjunction with `api_is_at_least()`, to allow
    client code to robustly identify expected behavior and API support through
    conditional execution and branching. Note that behavior is strongly
    specified by the API major version number. Features that have become part of
    the specification and bug-fixes referring to previous major versions should
    not be checked with *has_feature()*. Using *has_feature()* with old feature
    names will produce a DeprecationWarning for at least one major version, and
    client code should be updated to avoid logic errors in future versions.

    For convenience, setting ``enable_exception = True`` causes the function to
    instead raise a gmxapi.exceptions.FeatureNotAvailableError for unrecognized feature names.
    This allows extension code to cleanly produce a gmxapi exception instead of
    first performing a boolean check. Also, some code may be unexecutable for
    more than one reason, and sometimes it is cleaner to catch all
    `gmxapi.exceptions.Error` exceptions for a code block, rather than to
    construct complex conditionals.

    Returns:
        True if named feature is recognized by the installed package, else False.

    Raises:
        gmxapi.exceptions.FeatureNotAvailableError: If ``enable_exception == True`` and feature is not found.
