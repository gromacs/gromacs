"""Python logging facilities use the built-in logging module.

Upon import, the gmxapi package configures the root Python logger with a
placeholder "NullHandler" to reduce default output. If logging has already been
imported when gmxapi is imported, this has no effect. However, we set the root
log level to DEBUG, which could increase the output from other modules.

Each module in the gmxapi package uses its own hierarchical logger to allow
granular control of log handling (e.g. `logging.getLogger('gmxapi.operation')`).
Refer to the Python :py:mod:`logging` module for information on connecting to and handling
logger output.
