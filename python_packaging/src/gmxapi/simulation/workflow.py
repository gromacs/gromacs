    """
    Container of workflow elements with data dependency
    information and requirements for execution.

    An element cannot be added to a WorkSpec if it has dependencies that are not
    in the WorkSpec.

    Work is added to the specification by passing a WorkElement object to
    :py:func:`WorkSpec.add_element()`.
    Any dependencies in the WorkElement must already be specified in the target WorkSpec.

    When iterated over, a WorkSpec object returns WorkElement objects.
    WorkElement objects are yielded in a valid order to keep dependencies
    satisfied, but not necessarily the same order in which add_element()
    calls were originally made. In other words, the WorkSpec is a directed
    acyclic dependency graph, and its iterator returns nodes in an arbitrary
    but topologically correct order.

    The string representation of a WorkSpec object is a valid JSON serialized data object.

    The schema for version 0.1 of the specification allows data structures like
    the following.
    ::

        {
            'version': 'gmxapi_workspec_0_1',
            'elements':
            {
                'myinput':

                    'params': ['data_filename']
                },
                'mypotential':
                {
                    'namespace': 'myplugin',
                    'operation': 'create_mdmodule',
                    'params': {...},
                    'depends': ['mydata']
                },
                'mysim':
                {

                }
            }
        }

    The first mapping (``version``) is required as shown. The ``elements`` map
    contains uniquely named elements specifying an operation, the operation's
    namespace, and parameters and dependencies of the operation for this element.
    ``depends`` is a sequence of string names of elements that are also in the
    work spec. ``params`` is a key-value map with string keys and values that
    are valid JSON data. ``namespace`` and ``operation`` are strings that the
    :py:class:`Context <gmx.context.Context>` can map to directors it uses to
    construct the session. Namespace ``gmxapi`` is reserved for operations
    specified by the API. Namespace ``gromacs`` is reserved for operations
    implemented as GROMACS adapters (versioned separately from gmxapi). The
    period character (".") has special meaning and should not be used in naming
    elements, namespaces, or operations.

    Generates a work specification based on the provided simulation input and returns a handle to the
    MD simulation element of the workflow. Key word arguments can override simulation behavior from
    ``input``.

    If the MD operation discovers artifacts from a previous simulation that was launched from the same input,
    the simulation resumes from the last checkpointed step. If ``append_output`` is set ``False``, existing
    artifacts are kept separate from new output with the standard file naming convention,
    and new output begins from the last checkpointed step, if any.

    Setting ``end_time`` redefines the end point of the simulation trajectory from what was provided in
    ``input``. It is equivalent to changing the number of steps requested in the MDP (or TPR) input, but
    the time is provided as picoseconds instead of a number of time steps.

    .. deprecated:: 0.0.7
        If ``steps=N`` is provided and N is an integer
        greater than or equal to 1, the MD operation advances the trajectory by ``N`` steps, regardless of the number
        of simulation steps specified in ``input`` or ``end_time``. For convenience, setting ``steps=None`` does not override
        ``input``.
        Note that when it is not ``None``, ``steps`` takes precedence over ``end_time`` and ``input``, but can still be
        superceded by a signal, such as if an MD plugin or other code has a simulation completion condition that occurs
        before ``N`` additional steps have run.

    Where key word arguments correspond to ``gmx mdrun`` command line options, the corresponding flags are noted below.

    Keyword Arguments:
        input (str): *Required* string or list of strings giving the filename(s) of simulation input
        append_output (bool): Append output for continuous trajectories if True, truncate existing output data if False. (default True)
        end_time (float): Specify the final time in the simulation trajectory, overriding input read from TPR.
        grid (tuple): Domain decomposition grid divisions (nx, ny, nz). (-dd)
        max_hours (float): Terminate after 0.99 times this many hours if simulation is still running. (-maxh)
        pme_ranks (int): number of separate ranks to be used for PME electrostatics. (-npme)
        threads_per_pme_rank (int): Number of OpenMP threads per PME rank. (-ntomp_pme)
        steps (int): Override input files and run for this many steps. (-nsteps; deprecated)
        threads (int): Total number of threads to start. (-nt)
        threads_per_rank (int): number of OpenMP threads to start per MPI rank. (-ntomp)
        tmpi (int): number of thread-MPI ranks to start. (-ntmpi)
