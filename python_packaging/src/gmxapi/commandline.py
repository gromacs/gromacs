    """Execute a command line program in a subprocess.

    Configure an executable in a subprocess. Executes when run in an execution
    Context, as part of a work graph or via gmx.run(). Runs in the current
    working directory.

    Shell processing is not enabled, but can be considered for a future version.
    This means that shell expansions such as environment variables, globbing (`*`),
    and other special symbols (like `~` for home directory) are not available.
    This allows a simpler and more robust implementation, as well as a better
    ability to uniquely identify the effects of a command line operation. If you
    think this disallows important use cases, please let us know.

    Arguments:
         command : a tuple (or list) to be the subprocess arguments, including `executable`
         output : mapping of command line flags to output filename arguments
         shell : unused (provides forward-compatibility)

    Arguments are iteratively added to the command line with standard Python
    iteration, so you should use a tuple or list even if you have only one parameter.
    I.e. If you provide a string with `arguments="asdf"` then it will be passed as
    `... "a" "s" "d" "f"`. To pass a single string argument, `arguments=("asdf")`
    or `arguments=["asdf"]`.

    `input` and `output` should be a dictionary with string keys, where the keys
    name command line "flags" or options.

    Example:
        Execute a command named `exe` that takes a flagged option for file name
        (stored in a local Python variable `my_filename`) and an `origin` flag
        that uses the next three arguments to define a vector.

            >>> my_filename = "somefilename"
            >>> result = cli(('exe', '--origin', 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, '-f', my_filename), shell=False)
            >>> assert hasattr(result, 'file')
            >>> assert hasattr(result, 'erroroutput')
            >>> assert hasattr(result, 'returncode')

    Returns:
        A data structure with attributes for each of the results `file`, `erroroutput`, and `returncode`

    Result object attributes:
        * `file`: the mapping of CLI flags to filename strings resulting from the `output` kwarg
        * `erroroutput`: A string of error output (if any) if the process failed.
        * `returncode`: return code of the subprocess.

    # * Otherwise, STDOUT and/or STDERR is(are) closed when command is called.
