gmxapi core module
==================

gmxapi._gmxapi provides Python access to the GROMACS C++ API so that client code can be
implemented in Python, C++, or a mixture. The classes provided are mirrored on the
C++ side in the gmxapi namespace as best as possible.

This documentation is generated from C++ extension code. Refer to C++ source
code and developer documentation for more details.
