# Python setuptools script to build and install the gmxapi Python interface
# from a GROMACS installation directory.

# Usage note: things go smoothly when we stick to the setup.py convention of
# having a package source directory with the same name as the package at the
# same level as the setup.py script and only expect `pip install .` in the
# setup.py directory. If we play with the layout more, it is hard to keep all
# of the `pip` and `setup.py` cases working as expected. This is annoying
# because running the Python interpreter immediately from the same directory
# can find the uninstalled source instead of the installed package. We can
# ease this pain by building an sdist in the enclosing CMake build scope
# and encouraging users to `pip install the_sdist.archive`. Otherwise, we
# just have to document that we only support full build-install of the Python
# package from the directory containing setup.py, which may clutter that
# directory with some artifacts.

usage = """
The `gmxapi` package requires an existing GROMACS installation, version 2020 or higher.
To specify the GROMACS installation to use, provide a GMXTOOLCHAINDIR
environment variable when running setup.py or `pip`.

Example:
    GMXTOOLCHAINDIR=/path/to/gromacs/share/cmake/gromacs pip install gmxapi

If you have multiple builds of GROMACS, distinguished by a suffix `$SUFFIX`, the
tool chain directory will use that suffix.

Example:
    GMXTOOLCHAINDIR=/path/to/gromacs/share/cmake/gromacs$SUFFIX pip install gmxapi

In the example, `gmxapi` is downloaded automatically from pypi.org. You can
replace `gmxapi` with a local directory or archive file to build from a source
distribution.

setup.py will use the location of GMXTOOLCHAINDIR to locate the
gmxapi library configured during GROMACS installation. Alternatively, if
gmxapi_DIR is provided, or if GMXRC has been "sourced", the toolchain file
location may be deduced. Note, though, that if multiple GROMACS installations
exist in the same location (with different suffixes) only the first one will be
used when guessing a toolchain, because setup.py does not know which corresponds
to the gmxapi support library.

If specifying GMXTOOLCHAINDIR and gmxapi_DIR, the tool chain directory must be 
located within a subdirectory of gmxapi_DIR.

Refer to project web site for complete documentation.
