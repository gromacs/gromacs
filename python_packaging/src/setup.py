# Python setuptools script to build and install the gmxapi Python interface
# from a GROMACS installation directory.

# Usage note: things go smoothly when we stick to the setup.py convention of
# having a package source directory with the same name as the package at the
# same level as the setup.py script and only expect `pip install .` in the
# setup.py directory. If we play with the layout more, it is hard to keep all
# of the `pip` and `setup.py` cases working as expected. This is annoying
# because running the Python interpreter immediately from the same directory
# can find the uninstalled source instead of the installed package. We can
# ease this pain by building an sdist in the enclosing CMake build scope
# and encouraging users to `pip install the_sdist.archive`. Otherwise, we
# just have to document that we only support full build-install of the Python
# package from the directory containing setup.py, which may clutter that
# directory with some artifacts.
