The GROMACS developers generally suggest you install GROMACS for
production scientific use only from a tarball from an official
source-code release.

However, if you have a special need and wish to build and/or install a
version you from a git repository, please see
docs/install-guide/index.rst in this repository, or (if applicable)
the latest master branch documentation found via
http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/.

Note for GROMACS developers
---------------------------
When GROMACS source tarballs are made by CPack, an INSTALL file
containing those installation instructions is compiled via Sphinx from
that .rst into plain text and packaged into the tarball. This file is
excluded from the CPack source packages, and not included in CPack
binary packages.
