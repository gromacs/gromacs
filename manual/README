So, you want to build the manual? This is now easy.

1. Configure the main GROMACS repo with BUILD_MANUAL=on
2. make will now build GROMACS in the usual way, and use the
   generated binaries to build the manual.

An installation of pdflatex is assumed by the UseLATEX.cmake
package (http://www.itk.org/Wiki/CMakeUserUseLATEX)
that is used by manual/CMakeLists.txt.
