\chapter{Run parameters and Programs}
\label{ch:programs}

\section{On-line and HTML manuals}
\index{online manual}
\index{html manual}
All the information in this chapter can also be found in HTML
format in your GROMACS data directory. The path depends on
where your files are installed, but the default location is \\
\centerline{\tt /usr/local/gromacs/share/html/online.html}
Or, if you installed from Linux packages it can be found as\\
\centerline{\tt /usr/local/share/gromacs/html/online.html}
You can also use the online from our web site,\\
\centerline{\href{http://manual.gromacs.org/current/}{http://manual.gromacs.org/current/}}

In addition, we install standard UNIX manuals for all the programs. If
you have sourced the {\tt GMXRC} script in the GROMACS binary directory for
your host they should already be present in your {\tt \$MANPATH}, and you
should be able to type {\eg} {\tt man grompp}.

The program manual pages can also be found in
\appref{progman} in this manual.

\section{File types\swapindexquiet{file}{type}}
\label{sec:fileformats}
\tabref{form} lists the file types used by {\gromacs} along with
a short description, and you can find a more detail description for
each file in your HTML reference, or in our online version.

{\gromacs} files written in \normindex{XDR} format can be read on any
architecture with {\gromacs} version 1.6 or later if the configuration
script found the XDR libraries on your system. They should always be
present on UNIX since they are necessary for NFS support.
